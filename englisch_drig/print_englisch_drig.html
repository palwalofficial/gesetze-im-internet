the first state examination comprises a university examination covering areas of specialisation and a state examination covering compulsory subjects.</p><p><a name="p0028"><!----></a>(2) The content of the university studies and preparatory training is to be coordinated.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0029">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0029"><!----></a>Section 5a<br />University studies</p><p><a name="p0030"><!----></a>(1) University studies last four and a half years; this period may be shorter if the requisite attainments for admission to the university examination covering areas of specialisation and to the state examination covering compulsory subjects have been demonstrated. At least two years must be spent studying at a university within the area of application of this Act.</p><p><a name="p0031"><!----></a>(2) The course of studies comprises compulsory subjects and areas of specialisation with elective subjects. In addition, proof is required of having successfully completed a law course in a foreign language or a language course geared specifically to law; provision may be made under <i>Land</i> law that proof of foreign language skills can be provided in another manner. Compulsory subjects are the core areas of civil law, criminal law, public law and the law of procedure, including their links to European law, the methodology of legal science and the philosophical, historical and social foundations; the teaching of the compulsory subjects also includes a critical analysis of the injustices of the National Socialist regime and of the Communist dictatorship in Germany. The areas of specialisation serve to supplement university studies, to deepen knowledge of the compulsory subjects to which they relate and to impart the interdisciplinary and international bearing of the law.</p><p><a name="p0032"><!----></a>(3) The course of studies covers the ethical foundations of law and promotes students&#8217; ability to reflect critically on the law; it, further, covers the practice of court adjudication, the administration and legal advice, including the key qualifications required therefor, such as negotiation management, negotiation skills, rhetoric, conciliation, mediation, questioning techniques and communication skills. During the period in which lectures are not held, time is spent on practical studies for a total of at least three months. <i>Land</i> law may provide that the time spent on practical studies is spent continuously at one place.</p><p><a name="p0033"><!----></a>(4) Detailed provision is made under <i>Land</i> law.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0034">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0034"><!----></a>Section 5b<br />Preparatory training</p><p><a name="p0035"><!----></a>(1) The period of preparatory training lasts two years.</p><p><a name="p0036"><!----></a>(2) Training includes the following compulsory periods of training:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0037"><!----></a>1.  at a court of ordinary jurisdiction in civil matters,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0038"><!----></a>2.  at a public prosecutor&#8217;s office or at a court with jurisdiction in criminal matters,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0039"><!----></a>3.  at an administrative authority,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0040"><!----></a>4.  with a lawyer (<i>Rechtsanwalt</i>),</p><p><a name="p0041"><!----></a>and one or more elective periods of training in which appropriate training is guaranteed.</p><p><a name="p0042"><!----></a>(3) The training may take place on an appropriate scale with supranational, intergovernmental or foreign training agencies or with foreign lawyers. Training undertaken at a faculty of law and at the German University of Administrative Sciences Speyer can be credited. <i>Land</i> law may provide that the training pursuant to subsection (2) no. 1 may partly be undertaken at a court with jurisdiction in labour matters and the training pursuant to subsection (2) no. 3 may partly be undertaken at a court with jurisdiction in administrative, financial or social matters.</p><p><a name="p0043"><!----></a>(4) Each compulsory training period lasts at least three months, and compulsory training with a lawyer lasts nine months; <i>Land</i> law may provide that the training pursuant to subsection (2) no. 4 may be undertaken for up to three months with a public notary, a company, an association or at another training place where appropriate training in the provision of legal advice is ensured. Preparatory training may be extended in individual cases for compelling reasons but not, however, on account of inadequate performance.</p><p><a name="p0044"><!----></a>(5) Provision may be made for training courses as part of training lasting up to a total of three months.</p><p><a name="p0045"><!----></a>(6) The opportunity to undertake the preparatory training on a part-time basis is to be afforded upon application where a person is actually caring for or providing nursing care to</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0046"><!----></a>1.  at least one child under the age of 18 years, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0047"><!----></a>2.  a spouse, life partner or person related in the direct line who, according to a medical certificate, has nursing care needs.</p><p><a name="p0048"><!----></a>Where special reasons exist which are comparable in nature and scope to the reasons referred to in sentence 1 and which constitute considerable hardship, the opportunity to undertake the preparatory training on a part-time basis is to be afforded upon application. Where the preparatory training is undertaken on a part-time basis, the regular training is reduced by one fifth. Preparatory training undertaken on a part-time basis lasts two and a half years. The period by which the preparatory training is extended is to be spread across the compulsory periods of training in an appropriate manner.</p><p><a name="p0049"><!----></a>(7) Detailed provision is made under <i>Land</i> law.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0050">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0050"><!----></a>Section 5c<br />Crediting of training for higher intermediate service</p><p><a name="p0051"><!----></a>(1) Successfully completed training for the higher intermediate judicial administration service and for the higher intermediate non-technical administrative service can, on application and for a period not exceeding 18 months, count towards the length of training. However, no more than six months can count towards the preparatory training.</p><p><a name="p0052"><!----></a>(2) Detailed provision is made under <i>Land</i> law.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0053">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0053"><!----></a>Section 5d<br />Examinations; authorisation to issue statutory instruments</p><p><a name="p0054"><!----></a>(1) The state and university examinations relate to the requirements as to content in section 5a (3) sentence 1; notwithstanding section 5a (2) sentence 2, examinations may also take account of foreign language skills. Standardisation of examination requirements and achievement rating is to be ensured. The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection is authorised to determine, by way of a statutory instrument requiring the approval of the Bundesrat, a scale of marks and points for the individual and overall marks for all examinations.</p><p><a name="p0055"><!----></a>(2) The syllabus for the university examination covering areas of specialisation and for the state examination covering compulsory subjects is to be designed so as to enable university studies to be completed after five years of study. The university examination covering areas of specialisation must include at least one written assignment. The state examination covering compulsory subjects must comprise both written assignments and oral examinations; <i>Land</i> law may provide that examinations can be taken during the course of studies, though not before the end of two and a half years of study. The first state examination certificate lists the results of the university examination covering areas of specialisation which has been passed and of the state examination covering compulsory subjects which has been passed, as well as the overall mark, to which the result of the state examination covering compulsory subjects contributes 70 per cent and the result of the university examination covering areas of specialisation contributes 30 per cent; the certificate is issued by that <i>Land</i> in which the state examination covering compulsory subjects was passed.</p><p><a name="p0056"><!----></a>(3) The written examinations forming the second state examination are to be taken in the 18th month of training at the earliest and in the 21st month of training at the latest; where training is undertaken on a part-time basis in accordance with section 5b (6) sentence 1, appropriate account is to be taken of the fact that the preparatory training period has been extended. At a minimum, the written examinations relate to the compulsory training periods. Where <i>Land</i> law stipulates that a home assignment is to be performed in addition to assignments performed under invigilation, provision may be made to the effect that such assignment must be performed after completion of the last compulsory period of training. The oral examinations relate to the entire period of training.</p><p><a name="p0057"><!----></a>(4) In the first and the second state examinations the examining body may deviate in its decision from the arithmetically calculated total mark where such deviation better reflects the candidate&#8217;s performance in view of the overall impression gained and this has no influence on the candidate&#8217;s passing the examination; performance during preparatory training is also to be taken into consideration in respect of the second state examination. The deviation may not exceed one third of the average range of a particular mark. The proportion of oral examination attainments may not exceed 40 per cent of the total mark. In determining the total mark given for the second examination, no account is taken of marks given during preparatory training.</p><p><a name="p0058"><!----></a>(5) The state examination covering compulsory subjects may be repeated once. A failed state examination covering compulsory subjects is deemed not to have been taken if the candidate registered early for the examination and completed the required examination assignment in full. Detailed provision, in particular as regards the expiry of the registration deadline, the crediting of periods of study abroad, of illness or of release from study towards the total period of study, as well as the repercussions of interrupted examinations, is made under <i>Land</i> law. <i>Land</i> law may enable candidates to repeat the examination for the purpose of improving their grade.</p><p><a name="p0059"><!----></a>(6) Detailed provision is made under <i>Land</i> law. It may also determine that the written assignments forming part of the state examinations may be submitted in electronic form.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0060">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0060"><!----></a>Section 6<br />Recognition of examinations</p><p><a name="p0061"><!----></a>(1) Candidates may not be refused admission to preparatory training because they took the university examination covering areas of specialisation or the state examination covering compulsory subjects pursuant to section 5 in another <i>Land</i> within the area of application of this Act.

In the notice of appeal the fundamental importance of the case must be expounded or reference must be made to the decision of the Federal Service Court from which the judgment deviates. The lodging of an appeal prevents the judgment from entering into final and binding effect. Where relief is not granted, a decision is given by the Federal Service Court by way of an order. Where the appeal is unanimously dismissed on the ground of inadmissibility or of ill-foundedness, the court is not required to give reasons.
