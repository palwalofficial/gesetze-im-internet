Deviations from this methodology require a majority decision by the members of the National Regulatory Control Council and the consent of the Federal Government. The need for a decision is to be considered in particular where a deviation from the internationally recognised rules for application of the SCM is otherwise to be anticipated.</p><p><a name="p0022"><!----></a>(4) In the initial determination of the cost parameters required to conduct the measurement for businesses (costs per unit; time required for each individual activity triggered by the legislation and the annual frequency of that activity; and the number of affected businesses), all bureaucracy costs arising from federal law are to be taken into consideration.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0023">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0023"><!----></a>Section 3<br />Composition and organisation of the National Regulatory Control Council</p><p><a name="p0024"><!----></a>(1) The National Regulatory Control Council shall be made up of ten members.
