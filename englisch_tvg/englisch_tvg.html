This rule applies accordingly in relation to normative terms of the collective agreement governing establishment-level issues and staff and works council matters.</p><p><a name="p0026"><!----></a>(2) If the collective agreement provides for and governs common institutions of the parties to the collective agreement (e.g. wage adjustment funds, paid leave funds, etc), these rules also apply directly and on a mandatory basis in relation to the articles of association of the institution and to the relationship between the institution and employers and employees who are bound by the collective agreement.</p><p><a name="p0027"><!----></a>(3) Agreements that derogate from a collective agreement are only permitted if the collective agreement allows for this or contain an amendment of the terms in favour of the employee. </p><p><a name="p0028"><!----></a>(4) A waiver of rights that have arisen by virtue of a collective agreement is permitted only by way of a compromise to which the parties to the collective agreement have given their consent. The forfeiture of rights provided for in a collective agreement is excluded. Time limits for the assertion of rights provided for in a collective agreement may be agreed only in the collective agreement.</p><p><a name="p0029"><!----></a>(5) Following the expiry of the collective agreement, its normative terms continue to apply until they are replaced by another agreement.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0030">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0030"><!----></a>Section 4a<br />Conflicts of collective agreements</p><p><a name="p0031"><!----></a>(1) To ensure the protection function, distribution function, peace function as well as the regulatory function of normative terms in the collective agreement, conflicts of collective agreements in an establishment are to be avoided.</p><p><a name="p0032"><!----></a>(2) Under the terms of section 3 an employer may be bound by more than one collective agreement with different trade unions. If collective agreements whose content is not identical agreed with different trade unions overlap in scope (conflicting collective agreements), only the normative terms of the collective agreement concluded with the trade union which at the date on which the most recent conflicting collective agreement was agreed has the most members in an employment relationship in the establishment (majority collective agreement) are applicable in the establishment; if, in the adoption of the majority collective agreement, the interests of groups of employees, also covered by the collective agreement which is not to be applied in accordance with the first half-sentence, were not given serious and effective consideration, the normative terms of this collective agreement are also applicable. If the collective agreements conflict only at a later date, this date is decisive for determining the majority. An establishment as defined in section 1 (1) sentence 2 of the Works Constitution Act (<i>Betriebsverfassungsgesetz</i>) and an establishment formed by a collective agreement as provided for in section 3 (1) nos. 1 to 3 of the Works Constitution Act are also included as establishments unless this obviously contradicts the objectives of subsection (1). This is the case, in particular, where the establishments formed by the parties to the collective agreement have been allocated to different sectors or value chains of such sectors.</p><p><a name="p0033"><!----></a>(3) In relation to normative terms of a collective agreement governing a staff and works council matter specified in section 3 (1) and section 117 (2) of the Works Constitution Act, subsection (2) sentence 2 only applies where this staff and works council matter has already been regulated in a collective agreement agreed by a different trade union.</p><p><a name="p0034"><!----></a>(4) A trade union may require the employer or association of employers to reproduce the normative terms of a collective agreement that conflicts with its collective agreement. The right to replication entails the conclusion of a collective agreement containing the normative terms of the conflicting collective agreement to the extent that the scope and normative terms of the collective agreements overlap. The normative terms of a collective agreement agreed as a replication in accordance with sentence 1 apply directly and on a mandatory basis to the extent that the collective agreement of the trade union that signs the replicating agreement is not applicable on the basis of subsection (2) sentence 2.</p><p><a name="p0035"><!----></a>(5) If an employer or an association of employers starts negotiations with a trade union on the conclusion of a collective agreement, the employer or association of employers is required to make this known in a timely and adequate manner. A different trade union whose functions, in accordance with its articles of association, include the conclusion of a collective agreement as referred to in sentence 1 is entitled to present its ideas and demands orally to the employer or association of employers.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0036">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0036"><!----></a>Section 5<br />Universal application of collective agreements</p><p><a name="p0037"><!----></a>(1) Upon a joint application by the parties to the collective agreement, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may in agreement with a committee composed of three representatives each from the umbrella organisations of employers and of employees (collective agreements committee) declare a collective agreement to be universally applicable where the declaration of universal application appears necessary in the public interest.

Section 7 (2) of the Posted Workers Act (<i>Arbeitnehmer-Entsendegesetz</i>) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0047"><!----></a>(2) Before a decision is taken on the application, employers and employees who would be affected by the declaration of universal application, trade unions and associations of employers interested in the outcome of the procedure as well as the highest labour authorities of the <i>Länder</i> in the areas covered by the collective agreement must be given the opportunity to submit written observations as well as to make statements at an oral public hearing. In justified cases, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may provide for participation at the hearing via video or telephone conference.</p><p><a name="p0048"><!----></a>(3) If the highest labour authority of a participating <i>Land</i> objects to the declaration of universal application requested, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may approve the application only with the consent of the Federal Government.</p><p><a name="p0049"><!----></a>(4) By virtue of the declaration of universal application, the normative terms of the collective agreement also cover the employers and employees within its scope who were previously not bound by the collective agreement. A collective agreement declared universally applicable pursuant to subsection (1a) must be complied with by the employer even if the employer is bound in accordance with section 3 by another collective agreement.</p><p><a name="p0050"><!----></a>(5) The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may in agreement with the committee specified in subsection (1) revoke a declaration of universal application in relation to a collective agreement where revocation appears necessary in the public interest. Subsections (2) and (3) apply accordingly. In all other cases, the universal application of a collective agreement ends on the expiry of the collective agreement.</p><p><a name="p0051"><!----></a>(6) The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may in individual cases confer on the highest labour authority of a <i>Land</i> the right to declare a collective agreement universally applicable as well as to revoke a declaration of universal application.</p><p><a name="p0052"><!----></a>(7) The declaration of universal application and the revocation of universal application require public notification.
