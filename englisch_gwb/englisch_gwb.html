An unfair impediment within the meaning of sentence 1 exists in particular if an undertaking</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0105"><!----></a>1.  offers food within the meaning of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (OJ L 31 of 1 February 2002, p. 1) last amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 (OJ L 231 of 6 September 2019, p. 1) below cost price, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0106"><!----></a>2.  offers other goods or commercial services not just occasionally below cost price, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0107"><!----></a>3.  demands from small or medium-sized undertakings with which it competes on the downstream market in the distribution of goods or commercial services a price for the delivery of such goods or services which is higher than the price it itself offers on such market,</p><p><a name="p0108"><!----></a>unless there is, in each case, an objective justification.

This does not apply if the enforcement of the provisions under sentence 1 falls within the competence of other federal authorities.

The obligation to notify concentrations under sentence 1 applies only to concentrations in which the acquiring undertaking's domestic turnover was more than EUR 50 million in the last business year and the undertaking to be acquired achieved a domestic turnover of more than EUR 1 Million in the last business year. Section 36(1) sentence 2 no 2 does not apply to concentrations notified by the undertaking in the economic sectors examined. In all other cases, the provisions of this Act applicable to concentrations within the meaning of Chapter 7 apply. If the conditions under sentence 1 continue to exist after the expiry of the three-year period, the Bundeskartellamt may extend the obligation to notify concentrations by three years; multiple extensions for three years at a time are permissible a maximum of three times.</p><p><a name="p0259"><!----></a>(3) The Bundeskartellamt may issue a decision determining that a significant and continuing malfunctioning of competition exists in at least one market which is at least national in scope, in several individual markets or across markets, insofar as, based on the information available to the Bundeskartellamt at the time of its decision, the application of the authority's other powers under Part 1 of this Act appears unlikely to be sufficient to eliminate the malfunctioning of competition effectively and permanently. The decision under sentence 1 is issued against one or more undertakings which can be considered addressees of the measures under sentence 6 or subsection (4). Undertakings whose conduct and their relevance for the market structure contributes significantly to the malfunctioning of competition qualify as addressees of the measures. When selecting the addressees and the remedies, particular account is also to be taken of the undertaking's market position. The Bundeskartellamt may at a later point in time issue a decision expanding the decision under sentence 1 to include further undertakings within the meaning of sentences 2 and 3. In the event of a finding pursuant to sentence 1 the Bundeskartellamt may impose on the undertakings concerned any behavioural or structural remedies necessary for eliminating or reducing the malfunctioning of competition. The remedies may in particular include the following:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0260"><!----></a>1.  the granting of access to data, interfaces, networks or other facilities,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0261"><!----></a>2.  requirements for the business relations between undertakings in the markets examined and at different market levels,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0262"><!----></a>3.  the obligation for undertakings to establish transparent, non-discriminatory and open norms and standards,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0263"><!----></a>4.  requirements for certain types of agreements or contractual arrangements, including contractual provisions regarding the disclosure of information,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0264"><!----></a>5.  the prohibition to unilaterally disclose information which facilitates parallel conduct by undertakings,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0265"><!----></a>6.  the accounting or organisational separation of parts of undertakings or business divisions.</p><p><a name="p0266"><!----></a>Section 32(2) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0267"><!----></a>(4) Under the conditions set out in subsection (3), the Bundeskartellamt may issue a decision ordering dominant undertakings and undertakings of paramount significance for competition across markets pursuant to section 19a(1) to dispose of shares in undertakings or assets if this measure is expected to eliminate or substantially reduce the significant and continuing malfunctioning of competition. The remedies under sentence 1 may be imposed only if the remedies under subsection (3) sentence 6 are not possible, not equally effective or would be more burdensome for the undertaking than the remedies under sentence 1. Before issuing the decision, the Monopolies Commission and the supreme <i>Land</i> authorities competent pursuant to Section 48(1) in whose territory the undertaking has its registered seat are to be given the opportunity to comment. The decision under sentence 1 is to be published in the Federal Gazette. Section 43(3) applies accordingly with the proviso that only the information under Section 39(3) sentence 2 nos 1 and 2 is to be published. The decision may be combined with ancillary provisions. Section 41(3) sentence 2 and subsection (4) apply accordingly. Assets have to be disposed of only if the proceeds amount to at least 50 per cent of the value determined by an auditor instructed by the Bundeskartellamt for the date of the annual financial statement preceding the decision pursuant to sentence 1. Insofar as the actual proceeds from the disposal are less than the value determined by the auditor instructed by the Bundeskartellamt, the undertaking disposing of the assets will receive an additional payment in the amount of half of the difference between the value determined and the proceeds actually received from the disposal. If the decision covers assets which prior to the initiation of proceedings under this subsection were the subject of a final clearance decision issued by the Bundeskartellamt or the European Commission or were acquired after the granting of a final ministerial authorisation, the decision is permissible only if the period between its service and the service of the merger control decision is greater than ten years. If no second-phase proceedings were initiated, the expiry of the deadline under Section 40(1) sentence 1 applies instead of the service of the merger control decision. Parts of the assets which an undertaking has disposed of due to an obligation under this subsection or due to a commitment made pursuant to subsection (6) may not be reacquired by the undertaking within five years of their disposal, unless the undertaking demonstrates that market conditions have changed in such a way that a significant and continuing malfunctioning of competition no longer exists.</p><p><a name="p0268"><!----></a>(5) A malfunctioning of competition may exist particularly in the following cases:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0269"><!----></a>1.  unilateral supply or buyer power,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0270"><!----></a>2.  restrictions on market entry, market exit, the capacities of undertakings or on switching to another supplier or buyer,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0271"><!----></a>3.  uniform or coordinated conduct, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0272"><!----></a>4.  foreclosure of access to input factors or customers through vertical relations.</p><p><a name="p0273"><!----></a>When examining whether a malfunctioning of competition exists, particular account is to be taken of the following:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0274"><!----></a>1.  number, size, financial strength and turnover of the undertakings active in the markets concerned or across markets, the undertakings' market shares and the degree of business concentration,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0275"><!----></a>2.  links between the undertakings in the relevant, upstream and downstream markets or otherwise related markets,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0276"><!----></a>3.  prices, quantities, choice and quality of the products or services offered on the relevant markets,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0277"><!----></a>4.  transparency and homogeneity of the goods on the relevant markets,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0278"><!----></a>5.  contracts and agreements between undertakings in the relevant markets,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0279"><!----></a>6.  the degree of dynamism in the relevant markets, and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0280"><!----></a>7.  the efficiency gains demonstrated, in particular cost savings or innovations, while allowing consumers a fair share of the benefit.</p><p><a name="p0281"><!----></a>A malfunctioning of competition is deemed continuing where over a period of three years it has existed permanently or occurred repeatedly and at the time the decision under subsection (3) is issued there are no indications that the malfunctioning is more likely than not to cease to exist within two years.</p><p><a name="p0282"><!----></a>(6) Section 32b applies accordingly to proceedings under subsections (3) and (4).</p><p><a name="p0283"><!----></a>(7) As a general rule, decisions under subsections (2) to (4) shall be issued within 18 months of publishing the final report under Section 32e(4).</p><p><a name="p0284"><!----></a>(8) In order to take remedial measures pursuant to subsections (3) and (4) in markets in the railway, postal and telecommunications sectors regulated by the Bundesnetzagentur, to which sector-specific competition law applies, and the regulated electricity and gas supply networks under the Energy Industry Act [<i>Energiewirtschaftsgesetz]</i>, the Bundeskartellamt needs the Bundesnetzagentur's agreement; the Bundesnetzagentur will in each case publish a statement on the matter.

The amount of the economic benefit may be estimated. Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies accordingly to the estimation of the benefit amount with the proviso that a preponderance of probability suffices. It is presumed that the economic benefit according to sentence 1 amounts to at least 1 per cent of the turnover achieved in Germany with the products or services related to the violation. The presumption under sentence 4 is to be based on the disgorgement period according to subsection (5) sentence 1. The presumption under sentence 1 in conjunction with sentence 4 cannot be countered by arguing that no economic benefit or merely a minor benefit has accrued. It can be rebutted only if the undertaking proves that neither the legal person or association of persons directly involved in the violation nor the undertaking made a profit in the corresponding amount in the disgorgement period. The determination of the undertaking's profit pursuant to sentence 7 is to be based on the profit achieved worldwide by all natural and legal persons as well as associations of persons operating as a single economic entity. The presumption according to sentence 1 in conjunction with sentence 4 does not apply if accruing a benefit is ruled out due to the special nature of the violation. The amount of money to be paid is to be specified in numbers and may not exceed 10 per cent of the total turnover generated by the undertaking or association of undertakings in the business year preceding the authority's decision.</p><p><a name="p0404"><!----></a>(5) The disgorgement of benefits may be ordered only within a time limit of up to seven years from termination of the infringement, and only for a time period not exceeding five years (disgorgement period).
