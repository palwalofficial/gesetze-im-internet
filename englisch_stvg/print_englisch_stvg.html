The provisions on the liability of a motor vehicle holder in accordance with section 7 (2) and (3), section 8 nos. 2 and 3 and sections 8a to 16 apply accordingly. Sentences 1 and 2 do not apply if the accident was caused by a trailer attached to a motor vehicle at the time of the accident that cannot drive on a level surface at a speed of more than 20 kilometres per hour, unless it is a motor vehicle with autonomous driving function within the meaning of section 1d (1) and (2) during autonomous operations.</p><p><a name="p0071"><!----></a>(2) If damage is caused to another person by a traction vehicle with a trailer (combination vehicle), the holder of each of these vehicles is liable to the other as joint and several debtors for the operation risk of the whole combination vehicle.

In the relationship of these holders to one another, only the holder of the traction vehicle is liable. Sentence 2 does not apply insofar as a greater danger was posed by the trailer than by the traction vehicle alone; in such a case, the obligation to adjust advancements depends on the extent to which the damage was caused primarily by the traction vehicle or by the trailer. As a rule, merely towing the trailer does not pose a higher risk.

If the driver of the combination vehicle in the cases provided for in section 19 (2), (3) and (5) is liable to make compensation for the damage, he or she may demand adjustment of advancements from the holders of the traction vehicles and the trailer under section 426 of the German Civil Code.
