The licence is issued in respect of the placement of children from one or more specific foreign countries (home countries). The licence entitles the agency to use the designation 'anerkannte Auslandsvermittlungsstelle' (Accredited Foreign Placement Agency); this designation may not be used without such licence. The licence may be issued where proof is furnished that the agency meets the accreditation criteria under subsection (1) to the specific degree necessary to carry out work in the field of intercountry adoption; it is to be refused where this is precluded by overriding concerns relating to cooperation with the respective home country. The <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office&#8217;s central adoption agency and the Federal Central Agency notify each other of any facts and circumstances relating to an accredited foreign placement agency as referred to in subsection (1).</p><p><a name="p0074"><!----></a>(3) Accreditation in accordance with subsection (1) or licensing in accordance with subsection (2) is to be withdrawn where the criteria for its being given were not met. It is to be revoked if the criteria subsequently cease to be met. Provisions incidental to accreditation or licensing as well as the consequences of infringing a particular criterion are subject to generally applicable legal provisions.</p><p><a name="p0075"><!----></a>(4) In order to be able to examine whether the criteria under subsection (1) or (2) sentence 3 continue to be met, the <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office&#8217;s central adoption agency is authorised to obtain information about the work of the adoption placement agency in general and in a specific individual case, about the personal and professional suitability of its management and staff, its legal circumstances and organisational structure, and about its legal entity&#8217;s financial circumstances. Where necessary to that end,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0076"><!----></a>1.  the <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office&#8217;s central adoption agency may request information, inspection of the files and submission of proof,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0077"><!----></a>2.  staff tasked with conducting this examination are permitted to enter property and business premises in the course of normal business hours; the fundamental right to inviolability of the home (Article 13 of the Basic Law (<i>Grundgesetz</i>)) is restricted to that extent.</p><p><a name="p0078"><!----></a>The adoption placement agency (section 2 (3), section 2a (4) no. 2) immediately informs the central adoption agency of that <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office in whose area the adoption placement agency has its seat where it has received information that it will no longer be in a position to properly fulfil its tasks. This is, in particular, to be assumed to be the case where the criteria under section 3 and subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 2 are no longer met.</p><p><a name="p0079"><!----></a>(5) Objections and contestation suits against orders issued by the <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office&#8217;s central adoption agency do not have suspensive effect.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0080">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0080"><!----></a>Section 4a<br />Procedure upon closure of an adoption placement agency</p><p><a name="p0081"><!----></a>(1) Where it is clear that an adoption placement agency (section 2 (3), section 2a (4) no. 2) is to close, it must immediately notify the central adoption agency of that <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office in whose area it has its seat, as well as the adoption applicants and adopters whom it is supporting, about the fact that it will be closing. Further, it must inform the adoption applicants and adopters about the consequences of its closing, in particular about the possibility of the placement procedure continuing and about file retention. Sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly where the adoption placement agency (section 2a (4) no. 2) permanently loses its licence in a home country.</p><p><a name="p0082"><!----></a>(2) Where an adoption placement agency (section 2 (3), section 2a (4) no. 2) closes, it immediately forwards those records and documents concerning each individual placement case (placement files) in all concluded and ongoing placement procedures to the central adoption agency of that <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office in whose area it had its seat. Where it is already clear when an adoption placement agency (section 2 (3), section 2a (4) no. 2) closes which adoption placement agency (section 9b, section 2 (3), section 2a (4)) is to continue an ongoing placement procedure, the adoption placement agency which is closing immediately forwards the placement files to that adoption placement agency.</p><p><a name="p0083"><!----></a>(3) Where, after an adoption placement agency (section 2a (4) no. 2) closes, reports concerning a child&#8217;s development (section 9 (4) sentence 1) still need to be prepared, the placement files are to be immediately forwarded to the local adoption placement agency (section 9b), which thereupon prepares these reports. The local adoption placement agency sends the reports to the central adoption agency of that <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office in whose area the adopters are habitually resident for forwarding in accordance with section 9 (4) sentence 1 no. 2. Once the last report has been prepared, the placement files are to be handed over to the central adoption agency of that <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Office in whose area the adoption placement agency which closed had its seat so that they may be stored in accordance with section 9c (1).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0084">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0084"><!----></a>Section 5<br />Prohibitions relating to placement</p><p><a name="p0085"><!----></a>(1) Adoption placement may only be carried out by those Youth Welfare Offices and <i>Land</i> Youth Welfare Offices which are authorised in accordance with section 2 (1) and by those agencies which are authorised in accordance with section 2 (3); all other agencies are prohibited from carrying out adoption placement.</p><p><a name="p0086"><!----></a>(2) It is prohibited, by means of giving or providing, for a commercial or business purpose, pregnant women resident or habitually resident within the area of application of this Act the opportunity to give birth outside the area of application of this Act, </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0087"><!----></a>1.  to determine that they are to hand over their child there for adoption,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0088"><!----></a>2.  to assist them in giving up their child in this way.</p><p><a name="p0089"><!----></a>(3) It is prohibited to carry out placement activities with the objective of enabling a third party to permanently take in a child, in particular by means of a man acknowledging paternity of a child which he did not father.
