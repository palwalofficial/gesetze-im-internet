The claim will be due on the third business day following the resolution adopted by the general meeting.

Where a stockholder is a legal entity or a partnership with legal capacity, their business name or name, seat and address are to be entered in the share register. A civil law partnership may be entered in the share register and changes may be made to its entry only if it has been entered in the company register. The stockholder is under obligation to provide to the company the particulars set out in sentences 1 and 2. The by-laws may stipulate further details as to the pre-requisites under which it is permissible to enter in a holder&#8217;s own name shares of stock belonging to some other party. Shares of stock belonging to a German, EU or foreign investment entity in accordance with the Investment Code (<i>Kapitalanlagegesetzbuch &#8211; </i>KAG), the shares or shares of stock in which are not exclusively held by professional or semi-professional investors, will be considered shares of the German, EU or foreign investment entity also in those cases in which they are co-owned by the investors; where the investment entity does not have a legal personality of its own, they will be considered shares of stock in the management company of the investment entity. For purposes of transmitting the details stipulated in sentences 1 and 2, the company establishes a notification system for the issuance of electronic shares of stock in cooperation with the body maintaining the register of the central register in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Act on Electronic Securities or of the crypto securities register in accordance with section 16 (2) of said Act.</p><p><a name="p0323"><!----></a>(2) Only parties who have been entered in the share register will enjoy rights or be subject to duties arising from the shares of stock in their relationship with the company.

The party registered is to notify the company without undue delay, upon the latter&#8217;s corresponding demand, of the extent to which the shares of stock regarding which said party is entered in the share register in fact belong to them; should this not be the case, the party registered is to provide the particulars required under subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2 for that party on behalf of whom the party registered is holding the shares. This applies accordingly to that party whose data are transmitted pursuant to sentence 2 or pursuant to this sentence. Subsection (1) sentence 6 applies accordingly; sentence 1 applies to the allocation of costs. Where the holder of registered shares of stock is not entered in the share register, the intermediary maintaining the securities account is under obligation, upon a corresponding demand being made by the company, to have itself separately entered in the share register, in the stead of the holder, in return for reimbursement by the company for the costs necessarily incurred. Where an intermediary is separately entered in the share register only temporarily in the context of registered shares of stock being transferred, this entry does not trigger any duties as a result of subsection (2) and will not lead to the application of restrictions set out in the by-laws as stipulated by subsection (1) sentence 5. Section 67d remains unaffected.</p><p><a name="p0326"><!----></a>(5) Where, in the view taken by the company, someone has been incorrectly entered in the share register as a stockholder, the company may cancel this entry only if it has previously notified the parties involved of the intended cancellation and has set a reasonable time limit within which they may lodge an objection. Where a party involved objects within the time limit, no cancellation will be made.</p><p><a name="p0327"><!----></a>(6) The stockholder may demand that the company inform them about the data concerning their person that have been entered in the share register. In the case of unlisted companies, the by-laws may make further provisions. The company may use the data contained in the register as well as the data provided under the terms of subsection (4) sentences 2 and 3 in order to fulfil the tasks incumbent on it in its relationship with the stockholders. It may use the data to advertise the enterprise only insofar as the stockholder does not object to this being done.

Declarations of intent to the company may be made to, and documents for the company may be served on, the company&#8217;s representatives set out in subsection (1) at the address entered in the Commercial Register. Notwithstanding the above, the declarations may be made, and the documents served, also at the registered address of the person authorised to receive service of documents pursuant to section 39 (1) sentence 2.</p><p><a name="p0443"><!----></a>(3) The by-laws may also stipulate that individual members of the management board have authority to represent the company alone or jointly with an officer of the company vested with full commercial power of attorney (<i>Prokurist</i>). The supervisory board may make the same stipulation provided the by-laws have granted it authority to do so. In these cases, subsection (2) sentence 2 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0444"><!----></a>(4) Members of the management board having authority to represent the company jointly may grant authority to individual members to engage in specific transactions or specific types of transactions.

A re-appointment or extension of the term of office, in each case for a maximum of five years, is permissible. This will require a new resolution to be adopted by the supervisory board, which may be so adopted at the earliest one year prior to expiry of the current term of office. Solely for appointments for a term shorter than five years may an extension of the term of office be provided for without a new resolution being adopted by the supervisory board, the pre-requisite being that this does not result in a total term of office longer than five years. This applies accordingly to the employment agreement; however, the employment agreement may provide that it is to continue in force until the expiry of the term should the term of office be extended.</p><p><a name="p0464"><!----></a>(2) Where several persons are appointed as members of the management board, the supervisory board may designate one member as chairperson of the management board.</p><p><a name="p0465"><!----></a>(3) A member of a management board consisting of several persons is entitled to request that the supervisory board revoke their appointment if said member temporarily is unable to fulfil the duties entailed by their appointment due to the protection accorded to working mothers, due to the member&#8217;s taking parental leave, due to their giving care to a family member or due to their having fallen ill. Where a management board member exercises this right, the supervisory board must revoke the appointment of said management board member</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0466"><!----></a>1.  and in so doing must make a commitment, in the case of the protection of working mothers, to re-appoint them upon expiry of the periods of protection set out in section 3 (1) and (2) of the Maternity Protection Act (<i>Mutterschutzgesetz</i> &#8211; MuSchG),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0467"><!----></a>2.  and in so doing must make a commitment, in the cases of parental leave being taken, care being given to a family member or the management board member having fallen ill, to re-appoint them following a period of up to three months as requested by the management board member; the supervisory board may refrain from revoking the appointment for grave cause.</p><p><a name="p0468"><!----></a>In the cases set out in sentence 2 no. 2, the supervisory board may revoke the appointment of the management board member, upon the latter&#8217;s request, while making a commitment to re-appoint them following a period of up to 12 months. The end foreseen for the prior term of office will continue in force also as the end of the term of office following the re-appointment. In all other cases, the provisions of subsection (1) remain unaffected. The requirement made in section 76 (2) sentence 2 as to the management board having to consist of, at a minimum, two persons, is deemed met also during the period governed by sentences 2 or 3 if, without the revocation, this requirement were met. Any instances in which the number of management board members falls below the minimum stipulated by the by-laws during the period governed by sentences 2 or 3 do not merit consideration. Section 76 (3a) and section 393a (2) no. 1 do not apply to appointments during the period governed by sentences 2 or 3 if, without the revocation, the requirement as to gender participation were met. Section 88 is to be applied accordingly during the period governed by sentences 2 or 3.</p><p><a name="p0469"><!----></a>(4) The supervisory board may revoke the appointment as member of the management board and the designation as chairperson of the management board for grave cause. Such grave cause consists of, in particular, gross dereliction of duties, inability to properly manage the company&#8217;s affairs, or a vote of no confidence by the general meeting, unless the confidence has been withdrawn on grounds that are manifestly irrelevant. This applies also to the management board appointed by the first supervisory board. The withdrawal is effective until its ineffectiveness has been determined by a court&#8217;s declaratory judgment and this has become final and binding. The claims attaching to the employment agreement are governed by the general provisions.</p><p><a name="p0470"><!----></a>(5) The provisions of the Act on Co-determination in the Coal, Iron and Steel Industry relating to the special majority required for a resolution to be adopted by the supervisory board regarding the appointment of a member of the board responsible for human resources and social welfare matters (<i>Arbeitsdirektor</i>) or the revocation of their appointment remain unaffected.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0471">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0471"><!----></a>Section 85<br />Appointment by the court</p><p><a name="p0472"><!----></a>(1) Where the management board lacks a required member, the court is to appoint such member upon the corresponding petition by a party involved if the matter is urgent.

For listed companies, the remuneration structure is to be oriented towards the promotion of a sustainable and long-term development of the company. Accordingly, a multi-year assessment basis as a rule is to govern the variable remuneration components; the supervisory board generally is to agree a means of providing for limitations in order to take account of extraordinary developments. Sentence 1 applies accordingly to pensions, surviving dependents&#8217; pension benefits, and benefits of a similar nature.</p><p><a name="p0479"><!----></a>(2) Where the economic situation of the company deteriorates at a time following the specifications such that the continued granting of the emoluments pursuant to subsection (1) would be inequitable for the company, the supervisory board or, in the case governed by section 85 (3), the court as a rule is to reduce the emoluments to a reasonable amount upon a corresponding petition having been filed by the supervisory board. Pensions, surviving dependents&#8217; pension benefits, and benefits of a similar nature may only be reduced pursuant to sentence 1 in the first three years following the date on which the management board member ceases to work for the company. Such reduction will not affect the employment agreement in any other regard. However, the member of the management board may terminate their employment agreement with effect as per the end of the following calendar quarter, observing a period of notice of six weeks.</p><p><a name="p0480"><!----></a>(3) Where insolvency proceedings are opened for the company&#8217;s assets and the insolvency administrator terminates the employment agreement of a member of the management board, that member may demand compensation for the damages suffered, as a result of the service relationship having been cancelled, only for the two years following the date on which the service relationship has expired.</p><p><a name="p0481"><!----></a>(4) Upon a demand being filed in accordance with section 122 (2) sentence 1, the general meeting may reduce the maximum remuneration established in accordance with section 87a (1) sentence 2 no. 1.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0482">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0482"><!----></a>Section 87a<br />Remuneration system of listed companies</p><p><a name="p0483"><!----></a>(1) The supervisory board of the listed company is to resolve on a clear and understandable system for the remuneration of the members of the management board. At a minimum, the remuneration system is to provide for the details of the following matters; however, it is to do so for remuneration components only insofar as they in fact form part of the system:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0484"><!----></a>1.  the determination of a maximum remuneration for the members of the management board;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0485"><!----></a>2.  the contribution the remuneration is to make to promoting the company&#8217;s business strategy and its long-term development;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0486"><!----></a>3.  all fixed and variable remuneration components and their relative share of the remuneration in each case;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0487"><!----></a>4.  all financial and non-financial criteria for granting variable remuneration components, including</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0488"><!----></a>a)  an explanation of how these criteria will contribute to promoting the objectives set out under no. 2, and</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0489"><!----></a>b)  a description of the methods used to determine whether the performance criteria have been met;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0490"><!----></a>5.  deferral periods applying to the disbursement of remuneration components;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0491"><!----></a>6.  means available to the company to reclaim variable remuneration components;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0492"><!----></a>7.  in the case of share-based remuneration:</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0493"><!----></a>a)  time limits,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0494"><!----></a>b)  the conditions for holding shares of stock following the acquisition, and</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0495"><!----></a>c)  an explanation of how this remuneration will contribute to promoting the objectives set out under no. 2;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0496"><!----></a>8.  as regards remuneration-related legal transactions:</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0497"><!----></a>a)  their term and the pre-requisites for their termination, including the applicable periods of notice,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0498"><!----></a>b)  any undertakings to pay compensation for dismissal, and</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0499"><!----></a>c)  the main features of the pension and early retirement schemes;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0500"><!----></a>9.  an explanation of how the remuneration terms and employment conditions of the company&#8217;s employees were taken into account in specifying the remuneration system, including an explanation as to which group of employees was involved;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0501"><!----></a>10  a presentation of the procedure applied in establishing the remuneration system and in implementing it, as well as the procedure for reviewing it, including the role that any potentially affected committees played and the measures that were taken to avoid and deal with conflicts of interest;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0502"><!----></a>11.  in the event of a remuneration system being submitted that has been reviewed in accordance with section 120a (3):</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0503"><!----></a>a)  an explanation of all key changes made and</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0504"><!----></a>b)  a summary of the extent to which the coordination with the stockholders regarding the remuneration system and the remuneration reports as well as the stockholders&#8217; comments were taken into account.</p><p><a name="p0505"><!----></a>(2) The supervisory board of the listed company formally is to establish the remuneration of the members of the management board based on a remuneration system submitted to the general meeting pursuant to section 120a (1) for its endorsement. The supervisory board may deviate from the remuneration system temporarily where this is necessary in the interests of the company&#8217;s well-being over the long term, provided the remuneration system specifies the procedure for so deviating from the system as well as the elements of the remuneration system that may be so derogated from.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0506">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0506"><!----></a>Section 88<br />Prohibition of competition</p><p><a name="p0507"><!----></a>(1) The members of the management board may not carry on a trade without the consent of the supervisory board, nor may they pursue any business in the company&#8217;s line of business, regardless of whether this is for their own account or that of others. Unless they have obtained such consent, they also may not be members of the management board of some other trading company, or managing directors or general partners thereof. The consent of the supervisory board may be granted only for specific trading activities or trading companies or for specific types of transactions.</p><p><a name="p0508"><!----></a>(2) Where a member of the management board violates this prohibition, the company may demand compensation of its damages. It may instead demand of the management board member that they allow the transactions they have entered into for their own account to be considered transactions entered into for the account of the company, and that they surrender the remuneration obtained for the transactions entered into for the account of some other party, or that they assign their claim to the remuneration.</p><p><a name="p0509"><!----></a>(3) The company&#8217;s claims will become statute-barred following the expiry of three months from the point in time at which the other members of the management board and the members of the supervisory board become aware of the measure resulting in the obligation to provide compensation for damages, or have reason, barring gross negligence, to become aware of same. Such claims will become statute-barred, irrespective of this awareness, or grossly negligent lack of awareness, following the expiry of five years from the date on which they have arisen.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0510">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0510"><!----></a>Section 89<br />Loans granted to members of the management board</p><p><a name="p0511"><!----></a>(1) The company may grant loans to the members of its management board only on the basis of a resolution adopted by the supervisory board. Such resolution may be adopted only for specific loan transactions, or types of loan transactions, and may not be adopted longer than three months in advance of said transactions. The resolution is to provide for the interest accruing on the loan and the repayment of same. Allowing members of the management board to draw amounts in excess of the emoluments to which they are entitled, namely also allowing them to draw advances towards emoluments, is equivalent to granting a loan. This does not apply to loans not exceeding a monthly salary.</p><p><a name="p0512"><!----></a>(2) The company may grant loans to its officers vested with full commercial power of attorney (<i>Prokurist</i>) and its agents empowered to bind the company in all aspects of its business (<i>Handlungsbevollmächtigte</i>) only with the consent of the supervisory board.

Subsection (1) sentences 2 to 5 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0513"><!----></a>(3) Subsection (2) applies also to loans granted to spouses, partners in a civil union or a minor child of a member of the management board, of some other legal representative, of an officer vested with full commercial power of attorney or of an agent empowered to bind the company in all aspects of its business. Furthermore subsection (2) applies to loans granted to a third party acting for the account of these persons or for the account of a member of the management board, of some other legal representative, of an officer vested with full commercial power of attorney or of an agent empowered to bind the company in all aspects of its business.</p><p><a name="p0514"><!----></a>(4) Where a member of the management board, an officer vested with full commercial power of attorney or an agent empowered to bind the company in all aspects of its business concurrently is a legal representative or member of the supervisory board of some other legal entity or partner of a commercial partnership, the company may grant a loan to such legal entity or commercial partnership only with the consent of the supervisory board; subsection (1) sentences 2 and 3 applies accordingly. This will not apply if the legal entity or the commercial partnership is affiliated with the company or if the loan is granted in order to enable the payment for goods that the company delivers to the legal entity or the commercial partnership.</p><p><a name="p0515"><!----></a>(5) Where a loan is granted in contravention of the stipulations of subsections (1) to (4), the loan is to be repaid immediately, irrespective of any agreements to the contrary, unless the supervisory board retroactively grants its consent.</p><p><a name="p0516"><!----></a>(6) Where the company is a credit institution or financial services provider to which section 15 of the Banking Act is to be applied, the provisions of the Banking Act apply instead of subsections (1) to (5).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0517">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0517"><!----></a>Section 90<br />Reports to the supervisory board</p><p><a name="p0518"><!----></a>(1) The management board is to report to the supervisory board on the following topics:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0519"><!----></a>1.  the business policy it intends to pursue and other fundamental matters of corporate planning (in particular financial planning, investment planning and human resources planning), in which context any instances are to be addressed in which actual developments deviate from the targets previously reported and the reasons therefor are to be provided;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0520"><!----></a>2.  the company&#8217;s profitability, in particular the return on equity;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0521"><!----></a>3.  the course of business, in particular the sales of the company, and its economic situation;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0522"><!----></a>4.  transactions that may have a significant impact on the profitability or liquidity of the company.</p><p><a name="p0523"><!----></a>Where the company is a parent undertaking (section 290 (1), (2) of the Commercial Code), the report also is to address subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures (section 310 (1) of the Commercial Code).

No dereliction of duties will be given in those instances in which the member of the management board, in taking an entrepreneurial decision, was within their rights to reasonably assume that they were acting on the basis of adequate information and in the best interests of the company. The members of the management board are to respect the secrecy of any confidential information and secrets of the company, particularly trade secrets or business secrets, of which they have become aware in the context of their activities in the management board.</p><p><a name="p0541"><!----></a>(2) Members of the management board acting in dereliction of their duties are liable as joint and several debtors to compensate the company for any damage resulting from their actions. Where it is in dispute whether or not they exercised the due care of a prudent manager faithfully complying with the relevant duties, the onus of proof is upon them. Where the company has taken out insurance to protect a member of the management board against risks arising from their professional activities for the company, the insurance policy is to provide for a deductible of at least 10 per cent of the damage, up to a minimum of 150 per cent of the annual fixed remuneration of the member of the management board.</p><p><a name="p0542"><!----></a>(3) The members of the management board are under obligation to provide compensation particularly in those instances in which, in contravention of the present Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0543"><!----></a>1.  contributions are restituted to the stockholders,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0544"><!----></a>2.  stockholders are paid interest or participate in the profits,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0545"><!----></a>3.  treasury shares of stock in the company or in some other company have been subscribed to, purchased, accepted in pledge or redeemed,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0546"><!----></a>4.  shares of stock are issued prior to their issue price having been fully paid in,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0547"><!----></a>5.  the company&#8217;s assets are distributed,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0548"><!----></a>6.  (repealed),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0549"><!----></a>7.  remuneration is granted to members of the supervisory board,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0550"><!----></a>8.  loans are granted,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0551"><!----></a>9.  shares of a new issue are issued in the context of the conditional capital increase and this is done outside of the purpose specified therefor or prior to the equivalent value having been fully paid.</p><p><a name="p0552"><!----></a>(4) The duty to provide compensation does not arise in relation to the company where the action taken is based on a lawful resolution adopted by the general meeting. The fact that the supervisory board has endorsed the action does not preclude the duty to provide compensation. The company may waive its claims to compensation, or conclude a compromise regarding these claims, only once three years have lapsed since the arisal of the claim, and only in those cases in which the general meeting approves this being done and no minority, the aggregate of whose shares is at least equivalent to one tenth of the capital stock, raises an objection and has it recorded in the minutes. The limitation in time does not apply where the party obligated to provide compensation is unable to pay their debts as they become due and concludes a compromise with their creditors in order to avert insolvency proceedings or if the compensation duty is provided for in an insolvency plan.</p><p><a name="p0553"><!----></a>(5) The company&#8217;s claim to compensation may also be asserted by its creditors insofar as they cannot obtain satisfaction from the company. However, this applies, in cases other than those governed by subsection (3), only in those instances in which members of the management board have grossly violated their duty to exercise the due care of a prudent manager faithfully complying with the relevant duties; subsection (2) sentence 2 applies accordingly. The duty to provide compensation will not be cancelled in relation to the creditors by a waiver by the company or by its concluding a compromise, nor will the fact that the action is based on a resolution adopted by the general meeting cancel this obligation. Where insolvency proceedings have been opened for the company&#8217;s assets, the insolvency administrator or the insolvency monitor is to exercise the right of the company&#8217;s creditors against the members of the management board for the duration of said proceedings.</p><p><a name="p0554"><!----></a>(6) The claims governed by the present provisions will become statute-barred, in the case of companies that were listed on a stock exchange at the time at which the dereliction of duties occurred, after 10 years; in the case of other companies after 5 years.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0555">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0555"><!----></a>Section 94<br />Deputy members of the management board</p><p><a name="p0556"><!----></a>The provisions applying to the members of the management board also apply to their deputies.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0557">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0557"><!----></a>Division 2<br />Supervisory board</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0558">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0558"><!----></a>Section 95<br />Number of members of the supervisory board</p><p><a name="p0559"><!----></a>The supervisory board consists of three members.

The minimum ratio is to be fulfilled by the supervisory board as a whole. Where, prior to the election, the side of the shareholder representatives or the side of the employee representatives raises an objection with the chairperson of the supervisory board, based on a resolution adopted by a majority, against the fulfilment of the ratio by the supervisory board as a whole, the minimum ratio for that election is to be fulfilled separately by the side of the shareholder representatives and by the side of the employee representatives. In all cases, the ratio is to be mathematically rounded up or down in order to achieve full numbers of persons. If, in the case of the ratio being fulfilled by the supervisory board as a whole, the higher ratio of women of one side is reduced subsequently and that side then objects to the fulfilment of the ratio by the supervisory board as a whole, then this will not render the composition of the respective other side ineffective. Where an election of members of the supervisory board by the general meeting and their delegation to the supervisory board violates the requirement as to the minimum ratio, this election will be null and void. Where an election is declared to be null and void for other reasons, the elections performed in the meantime do not violate the requirement as to the minimum ratio in this regard. The acts governing co-determination set out in sentence 1 are to be applied to the election of supervisory board members representing the employees.</p><p><a name="p0571"><!----></a>(3) In the case of listed companies that have resulted from a cross-border merger, a cross-border change of the legal form or a cross-border division whose supervisory or administrative organ consists, in accordance with the Act on Employee Co-Determination in the Case of a Cross-Border Merger or the Act on Employee Co-Determination in the Case of a Cross-Border Change of the Legal Form or of a Cross-Border Division, of the same number of shareholder representatives and of employee representatives, the ratio of women and men sitting on the supervisory or administrative organ must constitute, in each case, at least 30 per cent.

The notice is to cite the statutory provisions that are relevant in the view taken by the management board. The notice is to indicate that the supervisory board will be constituted in accordance with these provisions unless parties entitled to file a petition pursuant to section 98 (2) refer the matter to the court having jurisdiction pursuant to section 98 (1) within one month of the notice having been published in the Federal Gazette.</p><p><a name="p0575"><!----></a>(2) Where the matter has not been referred to the court having jurisdiction pursuant to section 98 (1) within one month of the notice having been published in the Federal Gazette, the new supervisory board is to be constituted in accordance with the statutory provisions cited in the notice published by the management board.

At the same point in time, the office of the current members of the supervisory board will expire.

The supervisory board is to adopt a resolution by simple majority on whether or not to file such a petition. Where the member of the supervisory board has been delegated to same on the basis of the by-laws, also those stockholders may file such petition whose shares of stock, in the aggregate, are at least equivalent to one tenth of the capital stock, or to a stake of 1 million euros.

The management board is under obligation to file such petition without undue delay unless it is to be expected that the additional appointment will be made in due time prior to the next meeting of the supervisory board. Where the supervisory board is to be comprised also of members representing the employees, the following parties also may file such petition:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0626"><!----></a>1.  the central works council of the company or, where only a single works council exists for the company, the works council, as well as, in the case of the company being the controlling enterprise of a group of enterprises, the group works council,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0627"><!----></a>2.  the central committee, or corporate council, representing the executive staff of the company or, where only a single council representing the executive staff exists for the company, the council representing the executive staff, as well as, in the case of the company being the controlling enterprise of a group of enterprises, the group council representing the executive staff,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0628"><!----></a>3.  the central works council of some other enterprise, the employees of which vote themselves in the election, or vote through delegates, or, where only a single works council exists in the other enterprise, the works council,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0629"><!----></a>4.  the central committee representing the executive staff, or the corporate council representing the executive staff, of some other enterprise, the employees of which vote themselves or vote through delegates, or, where only a council representing the executive staff exists in the other enterprise, the council representing the executive staff,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0630"><!----></a>5.  at least one tenth of those employees, or one hundred of them, who vote themselves in the election or who vote through delegates,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0631"><!----></a>6.  umbrella organisations of the unions that have the right to nominate members of the supervisory board representing the employees,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0632"><!----></a>7.  unions that have the right to nominate members of the supervisory board representing the employees.</p><p><a name="p0633"><!----></a>Where, pursuant to the Employee Co-Determination Act, the supervisory board is to consist also of members representing the employees, then besides the parties entitled to file a petition pursuant to sentence 3, one tenth, in each case, of the employees designated in section 3 (1) no. 1 of the Employee Co-Determination Act having voting rights or of the executives within the meaning of the Employee Co-Determination Act having voting rights are entitled to file a petition.

In urgent cases, the court is to appoint the additional members to the supervisory board also prior to expiry of said time limit upon a corresponding petition having been filed. The entitlement to file a petition is governed by subsection (1).

Where additional members are appointed to the supervisory board in order to obtain the full number required for it to have a quorum, this will apply only insofar as the number of supervisory board members required for it to so have a quorum enables this ratio to be maintained. Where a member of the supervisory board is to be replaced by a member who, according to the law or the by-laws, must meet particular pre-requisites as regards their person, the court-appointed supervisory board member also must meet these pre-requisites. Where a member of the supervisory board, regarding the election of whom an umbrella organisation of the unions, a union or the works councils would have nomination rights, is to be replaced, the court as a rule is to consider the nominations made by these bodies unless overriding interests of the company or of the general public conflict with the appointment of the person so nominated; the same applies, if the member of the supervisory board were to be elected by delegates, to common nominations submitted by the works councils of the enterprises in which delegates are to be elected.</p><p><a name="p0639"><!----></a>(5) In the case of listed companies, to which the Employee Co-Determination Act, the Act on Co-determination in the Coal, Iron and Steel Industry or the Supplementary Co-determination Act applies, the appointment by the court of additional members to the supervisory board is to be performed subject to the stipulations of section 96 (2) sentences 1 to 5.</p><p><a name="p0640"><!----></a>(6) The office of the court-appointed member of the supervisory board will cease to exist in any case as soon as the deficiency is remedied.</p><p><a name="p0641"><!----></a>(7) The court-appointed member of the supervisory board is entitled to reimbursement for their reasonable cash expenditures and, if remuneration is granted to the members of the company&#8217;s supervisory board, then the court-appointed member is entitled to remuneration for their activities. Upon the supervisory board member filing the corresponding petition, the court will establish the expenditures and the remuneration. A complaint may be lodged against the decision taken; filing a complaint on points of law is precluded. Based on the decision taken, compulsory enforcement can be pursued in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0642">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0642"><!----></a>Section 105<br />Incompatibility of membership in the management board and in the supervisory board</p><p><a name="p0643"><!----></a>(1) A member of the supervisory board may not concurrently be a member of the management board, nor may they permanently be a deputy of members of the management board, an officer of the company vested with full commercial power of attorney (<i>Prokurist</i>) or an agent of the company empowered to bind the company in all aspects of its business (<i>Handlungsbevollmächtigter</i>).</p><p><a name="p0644"><!----></a>(2) The supervisory board may appoint individual of its members as deputies of lacking management board members, or of management board members who are prevented from serving as such, but may do so solely for a period of time that has been limited in advance, and at a maximum for one year.

The deputy chairperson will enjoy the rights and have the duties of the chairperson only when the latter is prevented from serving as such.</p><p><a name="p0649"><!----></a>(2) Minutes are to be prepared of the supervisory board meetings that the chairperson is to sign. The minutes are to state the place and date of the meeting, the participants, the business set out in the agenda, the substantial content of the deliberations, and the resolutions adopted by the supervisory board. A violation of sentence 1 or sentence 2 will not render the resolution ineffective. Upon a corresponding demand being made, a copy of the minutes of the meeting is to be physically handed over to each member of the supervisory board.</p><p><a name="p0650"><!----></a>(3) The supervisory board may appoint from among its midst one or several committees, particularly for purposes of making preparations for its deliberations and resolutions, or in order to monitor the implementation of its resolutions. In particular, it may appoint an audit committee that is to monitor the accounting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal accounting control system as well as the auditing of accounts, and in this regard particularly the selection and the independence of the statutory auditor, the quality of the auditing of accounts and the services additionally provided by the statutory auditor. The audit committee may make recommendations or suggestions on how to warrant the integrity of the accounting process. Moreover, the supervisory board of the listed company may appoint a committee that is to adopt a resolution regarding the consent stipulated by section 111b (1). Any related parties involved in the transaction within the meaning of section 111a (1) sentence 2 are not eligible for appointment as members of said committee. The majority of the committee&#8217;s members must be persons regarding whom there are no concerns regarding a conflict of interest due to their relationship with a related party. The tasks pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1, section 59 (3), section 77 (2) sentence 1, section 84 (1) sentences 1 and 3, (2) and (3) sentences 2 and 3 as well as (4) sentence 1, section 87 (1) and (2) sentences 1 and 2, section 111 (3), section 171, section 314 (2) and (3), as well as the adoption of resolutions to the effect that certain types of business transactions may only be implemented with the consent of the supervisory board, may not be transferred to a committee instead of the supervisory board.

Where the supervisory board consists of no more than three members, it will also be the audit committee. The audit committee must meet the pre-requisites set out in section 100 (5). Each member of the audit committee may obtain information, via the committee chairperson, directly from the heads of those corporate units of the company that are responsible within the company for those tasks that are within the remit of the audit committee in accordance with subsection (3) sentence 2. The committee chairperson is to inform all members of the audit committee of the information so obtained.

In any case, at least three members must participate in adopting the resolution.

It may also instruct individual members to perform these tasks, or may commission special experts for certain tasks. The supervisory board instructs the statutory auditor to audit the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements pursuant to section 290 of the Commercial Code. Moreover, the supervisory board may instruct that an external audit be performed of the substance of the non-financial statement or of the separate non-financial report (section 289b of the Commercial Code), or of the consolidated non-financial statement or the separate consolidated non-financial report (section 315b of the Commercial Code).</p><p><a name="p0669"><!----></a>(3) The supervisory board is to convene a general meeting where this is required by the company&#8217;s best interests. It suffices for the corresponding resolution to be adopted by a simple majority.</p><p><a name="p0670"><!----></a>(4) The measures to be taken by the management may not be transferred to the supervisory board. However, it is to be determined in the by-laws or by the supervisory board that certain types of business transactions may be implemented only with the supervisory board&#8217;s consent. Where the supervisory board refuses to grant such consent, the management board may demand that the general meeting adopt a resolution concerning such consent. The resolution by which the general meeting grants its consent requires a majority of at least three quarters of the votes cast. The by-laws may neither stipulate a greater majority ratio, nor may they impose further requirements.</p><p><a name="p0671"><!----></a>(5) The supervisory boards of listed companies or companies that are subject to co-determination rights stipulate target values for the share of women sitting on the supervisory board and the management board. The target values must describe the share of women targeted for the body respectively concerned and must correspond, where percentages are cited, to full numbers of persons. Where the supervisory board stipulates the target value &#8220;zero&#8221; for the share of women sitting on the supervisory board or management board, it is to provide the reasons on which this resolution is based in clear and understandable terms. The reasoning must present the details of the deliberations on which the decision is based. Where the share of women is lower than 30 per cent at the time the target values are laid down, the target values stipulated no longer may be lower than the share respectively attained. Concurrently, time limits are to be set within which the target values are to be attained. In each case, the time limits may not be longer than five years. If the requirement as to the minimum ratio pursuant to section 96 (2) or (3) already applies to the supervisory board, the stipulations are to be made solely for the management board. If the requirement as to gender participation stipulated by section 76 (3a) applies to the management board, then the duty to set a target value for the management board likewise will lapse.</p><p><a name="p0672"><!----></a>(6) The members of the supervisory board may not have others perform the tasks incumbent on them.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0673">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0673"><!----></a>Section 111a<br />Related party transactions</p><p><a name="p0674"><!----></a>(1) Related party transactions are legal transactions or measures</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0675"><!----></a>1.  by which an object or some other asset is transferred or permission for its use is granted, for monetary consideration or without such monetary consideration, and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0676"><!----></a>2.  that are entered into with related parties as defined in sentence 2.</p><p><a name="p0677"><!----></a>Related parties are related enterprises or persons within the meaning of the international accounting standards that have been adopted, in each case as amended, by Commission Provision (EC) No. 1126/2008 of 3 November 2008 adopting certain international accounting standards in accordance with Provision (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 320 of 29 November 2008, p. 1; L 29 of 2 February 2010, p. 34), most recently amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/412 (OJ L 73 of 15 March 2019, p. 93).

Such consent may be granted only for specific loan transactions, or types of loan transactions, and may not be granted longer than three months in advance of same. The resolution as to the consent is to provide for the interest accruing on the loan and the redemption of same. Where the member of the supervisory board pursues a trading activity as a sole trader, no such consent will be required if the loan is granted in order to enable the payment for goods that the company delivers for the sole trader&#8217;s trading business.</p><p><a name="p0713"><!----></a>(2) Subsection (1) applies also to loans granted to spouses, partners in a civil union or a minor child of a member of the supervisory board and to loans granted to a third party acting for the account of these persons or for the account of a member of the supervisory board.</p><p><a name="p0714"><!----></a>(3) Where a member of the supervisory board concurrently is a legal representative of some other legal entity or a partner of a commercial partnership, the company may grant a loan to such legal entity or commercial partnership only with the consent of the supervisory board; subsection (1) sentences 3 and 4 applies accordingly.

In particular, the members of the supervisory board are under an obligation of secrecy regarding any confidential reports they may have received as well as regarding their confidential deliberations. More particularly, they are under obligation to provide compensation should they have established remuneration that is inappropriate (section 87 subsection (1)).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0719">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0719"><!----></a>Division 3<br />Exploitation of influence over the company</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0720">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0720"><!----></a>Section 117<br />Duty to provide compensation for damages</p><p><a name="p0721"><!----></a>(1) Anyone who intentionally compels, by exploiting their influence on the company, a member of the management board or of the supervisory board, an officer of the company vested with full commercial power of attorney (<i>Prokurist</i>) or an authorised agent to act to the detriment of the company or its stockholders will be under obligation to provide compensation to the company for the damage it has suffered as a result. Such party also will be under obligation to compensate the stockholders for the damage they have suffered as a result, insofar as they have suffered damage above and beyond the loss resulting for them by the damage caused to the company.</p><p><a name="p0722"><!----></a>(2) In addition to that person, the members of the management board and of the supervisory board are liable as joint and several debtors if they have acted in dereliction of their duties. Where it is in dispute whether they have exercised the due care of a prudent manager faithfully complying with the relevant duties, the onus of proof is upon them. The duty of the members of the management board and of the supervisory board to provide compensation will not arise in relation to the company and also not in relation to the stockholders if the action taken is based on a lawful resolution adopted by the general meeting. The fact that the supervisory board has endorsed the action does not preclude the duty to provide compensation.</p><p><a name="p0723"><!----></a>(3) In addition to that person, furthermore, those parties are liable as joint and several debtors who have obtained an advantage by the action causing damage, should such parties have intentionally instigated the influence being exerted.</p><p><a name="p0724"><!----></a>(4) Section 93 (4) sentences 3 and 4 applies accordingly to the release from the duty in relation to the company to provide compensation.</p><p><a name="p0725"><!----></a>(5) The company&#8217;s claim to compensation may also be asserted by its creditors inasmuch as they are unable to obtain satisfaction from the company. Any waiver by the company of its claims to compensation, or any conclusion by the company of a compromise regarding these claims, will not serve to release it from the duty to provide compensation to the creditors, nor will it be so released from this obligation by the fact that the action is based on a resolution adopted by the general meeting. Where insolvency proceedings have been opened for the company&#8217;s assets, the insolvency administrator or the insolvency monitor exercises the right of the company&#8217;s creditors for the duration of said proceedings.</p><p><a name="p0726"><!----></a>(6) The claims governed by the present provisions will become statute-barred within five (5) years.</p><p><a name="p0727"><!----></a>(7) The above provisions do not apply if the member of the management board or of the supervisory board, the officer of the company vested with full commercial power of attorney (<i>Prokurist</i>) or the authorised agent has been compelled to take the action causing damage by either of the following being exercised:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0728"><!----></a>1.  the power of direction based on a control agreement, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0729"><!----></a>2.  the power of direction of a principal company (section 319) into which the company is integrated.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0730">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0730"><!----></a>Division 4<br />General meeting</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0731">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0731"><!----></a>Subdivision 1<br />Rights of the general meeting</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0732">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0732"><!----></a>Section 118<br />General provisions</p><p><a name="p0733"><!----></a>(1) Unless stipulated otherwise by the law, the stockholders exercise their rights in matters pertaining to the company at the general meeting.

The right of other persons to convene the general meeting as stipulated by law or in the by-laws remains unaffected.</p><p><a name="p0782"><!----></a>(3) The invitation convening the general meeting must set out the business name of the company, its seat, as well as the time and place of the general meeting. Moreover, the agenda is to be provided. In the case of listed companies, the management board or, in cases in which the supervisory board convenes the general meeting, the supervisory board is to provide the following information in the invitation convening the general meeting:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0783"><!----></a>1.  the pre-requisites for participating in the meeting and exercising the voting right as well as, if applicable, the record date pursuant to section 123 (4) sentence 2 and its significance;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0784"><!----></a>2.  the procedure for votes to be cast</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0785"><!----></a>a)  by an authorised representative, with reference being made to the forms to be used for granting a power of attorney to exercise voting rights and to the manner and form in which it is possible to electronically transmit proof to the company regarding the appointment of an authorised representative, as well as</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0786"><!----></a>b)  by absentee ballot or by way of electronic communication pursuant to section 118 (1) sentence 2 insofar as the by-laws provide for a corresponding form of exercising the voting right;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0787"><!----></a>3.  The rights of the stockholders pursuant to section 122 (2), section 126 (1), as well as sections 127 and 131 (1); the information may be restricted to the time limits set for exercising the rights if the invitation convening the general meeting otherwise makes reference to further explanations made available on the company&#8217;s website;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0788"><!----></a>4.  The website of the company on which the information pursuant to section 124a is accessible.</p><p><a name="p0789"><!----></a>(4) Notice of the invitation convening the general meeting is to be given in the company&#8217;s publications of record. Where the stockholders of the company are known by name, the general meeting may be convened by registered letter unless stipulated otherwise in the by-laws; the date on which the invitation is posted is considered the date of the notice. The notification of the parties entered in the share register is sufficient.</p><p><a name="p0790"><!----></a>(4a) In the case of listed companies that have not issued exclusively registered shares of stock or that do not directly send the invitation convening the general meeting to the stockholders pursuant to subsection (4) sentence 2, the invitation convening the general meeting is to be forwarded, at the latest as per the time of the notice, to such media for publication regarding which it can be assumed that they will disseminate the information in the entire European Union.</p><p><a name="p0791"><!----></a>(4b) In the case of the virtual general meeting, the invitation convening the general meeting also must state how stockholders and their authorised representatives can participate in the general meeting by electronic means. Additionally, the invitation convening the general meeting is to indicate that a physical presence of the stockholders and their authorised representatives at the place at which the general meeting will be held is ruled out. In the case of the virtual general meeting of listed companies, information on the procedure for votes to be cast is to be provided, in derogation from subsection (3) sentence 3 no. 2 letter (b), by way of electronic communication. Moreover, in the case of these companies, reference additionally is to be made to section 126 (4) and, if the management board avails itself of the option provided for under section 131 (1a) sentence 1, additionally to section 131 (1a) to (1f), as well as the fact that the report by the management board or its substantial content will be made accessible in accordance with section 118a (1) sentence 2 no. 5.</p><p><a name="p0792"><!----></a>(5) Unless stipulated otherwise in the by-laws, the general meeting as a rule is to be held at the seat of the company. Where the shares of stock in the company are admitted to trading on the regulated market at a German stock exchange, then, unless stipulated otherwise in the by-laws, the general meeting also can be held at the seat of the stock exchange. In the case of the virtual general meeting, sentences 1 and 2 do not apply.</p><p><a name="p0793"><!----></a>(6) Where all stockholders are present in person or represented by proxies, the general meeting may adopt resolutions without adhering to the provisions of the present subdivision insofar as no stockholder objects to the adoption of the resolution.</p><p><a name="p0794"><!----></a>(7) In the case of time limits and deadlines that are counted back from the date of the general meeting, the date of the general meeting itself is not to be counted. Rescheduling the general meeting from a Sunday, a Saturday or a holiday to a preceding or subsequent business day is not an available option. Sections 187 to 193 of the Civil Code are not to be applied accordingly.

The by-laws may tie the right to demand that the general meeting be convened to a different form and to possession of a lesser portion of the capital stock. The petitioners are to submit proof that they have been holders of the shares of stock since a minimum of 90 days prior to the date on which their demand is received, and that they will continue to so hold the shares until the management board takes a decision regarding their petition. Section 121 (7) is to be applied accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0797"><!----></a>(2) In like manner, stockholders whose shares of stock, in the aggregate, are at least equivalent to one twentieth of the capital stock or to a stake of 500,000 euros, may demand that items of business be set out in the agenda and that notice be given by publication. Each item of business to be newly added to the agenda must include the reasons on which it is based or a proposal for a resolution. The demand within the meaning of sentence 1 must be received by the company at the latest 24 days prior to the general meeting, in the case of listed companies at the latest 30 days prior to the general meeting; the date on which the demand is received is not to be included in calculating the period.</p><p><a name="p0798"><!----></a>(3) Where the demand is not complied with, the court may grant authority to the stockholders who have made the demand to convene the general meeting or to give notice by publication of the item of business. Concurrently, the court may determine the chairperson of the general meeting. The invitation convening the general meeting or the notice must indicate the authorisation by the court. A complaint may be lodged against the decision taken. The petitioners are to submit proof that they will continue to hold the shares of stock until the court hands down its decision.</p><p><a name="p0799"><!----></a>(4) The company bears the costs of the general meeting and, in the case governed by subsection (3), also the court costs if the court has complied with the petition.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0800">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0800"><!----></a>Section 123<br />Time limit, registration for the general meeting, proof</p><p><a name="p0801"><!----></a>(1) The general meeting is to be convened at the latest 30 days prior to the date set for it.

The company must receive the registration at the address set out for this purpose in the invitation convening the general meeting at the latest six days prior to the general meeting. The by-laws, or the invitation convening the general meeting issued on the basis of an authorisation in the by-laws, may provide for a shorter time limit, which is to be measured in days. The date on which the registration is received is not to be included in calculating the time limit. The minimum time limit set out in subsection (1) is extended by the days of the time limit set for registration.</p><p><a name="p0803"><!----></a>(3) The by-laws may determine the manner in which proof is to be submitted of the entitlement to participate in the general meeting or to exercise the voting right; in such event, subsection (2) sentence 5 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0804"><!----></a>(4) In the case of bearer shares of listed companies, proof pursuant to section 67c (3) will suffice. In the case of listed companies, the confirmation of shareholding pursuant to section 67c (3) is to reflect the circumstances given as per the close of business of the twenty-second day prior to the general meeting and must be received by the company, at the address set out for this purpose in the invitation convening the general meeting, at the latest six days prior to the meeting. The by-laws, or the invitation convening the general meeting issued on the basis of an authorisation in the by-laws, may provide for a shorter time limit, which is to be measured in days. The date on which the registration is received is not to be included in calculating the period. Only those parties are considered stockholders of the company in their relationship with same, in terms of their participation in the general meeting or in terms of the exercise of the voting right, who have submitted proof in this regard.</p><p><a name="p0805"><!----></a>(5) In the case of registered shares of stock in listed companies, the entitlement to participate in the meeting or to exercise the voting right follows, pursuant to section 67 (2) sentence 1 from entry in the share register.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0806">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0806"><!----></a>Section 124<br />Notice by publication of demands for supplementation; guidance regarding resolutions</p><p><a name="p0807"><!----></a>(1) Where the minority pursuant to section 122 (2) has demanded that items of business be set out in the agenda, notice of said items of business is to be given by publication either together with the invitation convening the general meeting or, if that is not the case, without undue delay after the demand has been received. Section 121 (4) applies accordingly; moreover, in the case of listed companies, section 121 (4a) applies accordingly. The notice is to be published and forwarded in the same way as the invitation convening the general meeting.</p><p><a name="p0808"><!----></a>(2) Where the election of members of the supervisory board has been included in the agenda, the notice is to cite the statutory provisions governing the composition of the supervisory board; where the general meeting is bound by nominations, the notice is to cite this as well. Where the notice concerns an election to the supervisory board of a listed company, to which the Employee Co-Determination Act, the Act on Co-determination in the Coal, Iron and Steel Industry or the Supplementary Co-determination Act applies, it must furthermore provide the following information:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0809"><!----></a>1.  whether an objection has been raised against the fulfilment of the ratio by the supervisory board as a whole pursuant to section 96 (2) sentence 3 and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0810"><!----></a>2.  the number of seats on the supervisory board that must be filled, at a minimum, by women and men, respectively, in order to fulfil the requirement as to the minimum ratio pursuant to section 96 (2) sentence 1.</p><p><a name="p0811"><!----></a>If it is intended that the general meeting adopt a resolution regarding an amendment of the by-laws, the remuneration system for the members of the management board, the remuneration of the supervisory board pursuant to section 113 (3), the remuneration report or as regards a contract that is to enter into force only upon having been consented to by the general meeting, then notice is to be given by publication in the case of an amendment of the by-laws, the wording of the amendment of the by-laws, in the case of a contract designated above, the substantial content of that contract, and in all other cases, the full content of the documents relating to the individual objects of the resolution. Sentence 3 applies also in the case of section 120a (5).</p><p><a name="p0812"><!----></a>(3) In the notice published, the management board and the supervisory board are to provide guidance regarding the resolutions to be adopted on each item of business set out in the agenda regarding which the general meeting as a rule is to adopt a resolution; for resolutions to be adopted pursuant to section 120a (1) sentence 1 and for the election of members of the supervisory board and auditors, such guidance is to be provided solely by the supervisory board. In the case of companies that are public-interest entities as defined in section 316a sentence 2 of the Commercial Code, the nomination made by the supervisory board for the election of the statutory auditor is to be based on the recommendation of the audit committee. Sentence 1 does not apply if, in electing members of the supervisory board, the general meeting is bound to nominations pursuant to section 6 of the Act on Employee Co-Determination in the Iron- and Steel-Producing Industry, or if the item of business regarding which a resolution is to be adopted has been included in the agenda upon a corresponding demand having been made by a minority. The nominations of candidates for the supervisory board or as auditors are to state their names, the profession exercised, and their places of residence. Where the supervisory board is to consist also of members representing the employees, the resolutions adopted by the supervisory board regarding the nomination of candidates for the supervisory board will require solely the majority of the votes cast by the members of the supervisory board representing the stockholders; section 8 of the Act on Employee Co-Determination in the Iron- and Steel-Producing Industry remain unaffected.</p><p><a name="p0813"><!----></a>(4) No resolutions may be adopted regarding items of business set out in the agenda of which no notice duly and properly has been given by publication.

If the agenda is to be amended pursuant to section 122 (2), then notice of the amended agenda is to be given where the general meeting is that of a listed company. The notice is to indicate the option of exercising the voting right by proxy, as well as by an association of stockholders. In the case of listed companies, information on the candidates&#8217; membership in other supervisory boards mandated by law as a rule is to be attached to any nomination of candidates for the supervisory board; information on their membership in comparable supervisory committees of business enterprises within Germany and abroad as a rule is to be attached.</p><p><a name="p0828"><!----></a>(2) The management board of a company that has issued registered shares of stock is to provide the same notification as of the start of the twenty-first day prior to the general meeting to the parties entered in the company&#8217;s share register as well as to the stockholders and intermediaries that had demanded that such notice be given to them, and the associations of stockholders that had demanded that such notice be given to them or that had exercised voting rights at the last general meeting.</p><p><a name="p0829"><!----></a>(3) Each member of the supervisory board may demand that the management board send them the same notifications.</p><p><a name="p0830"><!----></a>(4) Upon a corresponding demand being made, each member of the supervisory board and each stockholder is to be notified of the resolutions adopted at the general meeting.</p><p><a name="p0831"><!----></a>(5) The requirements of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1212 apply as regards the content and format of a minimum amount of information to be provided in the notifications pursuant to subsections (1) sentence 1 and (2). Section 67a (2) sentence 1 applies accordingly to subsections (1) and (2). In the case of listed companies, the intermediaries serving as depositories for shares of stock in the company are under obligation, in accordance with sections 67a and 67b, to forward and transmit the information pursuant to subsections (1) and (2), unless the intermediary is aware that the stockholder is receiving such information from another source.

The company is to issue the confirmation in accordance with the requirements made in Article 7 (2) and Article 9 (5) sub-paragraph (2) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1212. Insofar as the confirmation is issued to an intermediary, the intermediary is to transmit such confirmation to the stockholder without undue delay. Section 67a (2) sentence 1 and (3) applies accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0868">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0868"><!----></a>Section 130<br />Minutes</p><p><a name="p0869"><!----></a>(1) Each resolution adopted by the general meeting is to be recorded in minutes of the meeting prepared by a notary. The same applies to any demand made by a minority pursuant to section 120 (1) sentence 2 and pursuant to section 137.

The ability to access the statements may be restricted to stockholders duly registered for the meeting. In the case of listed companies, the statements are to be made accessible via the company&#8217;s website; in the case governed by sentence 2, accessibility may be effected via a third-party website.

The duty to provide information also extends to include the legal and business relations of the company with an affiliated enterprise. Where a company avails itself of the eased requirements pursuant to section 266 (1) sentence 3, section 276 or section 288 of the Commercial Code, each stockholder may request that, at the general meeting deliberating on the annual financial statements, the annual financial statements be made available to them in the form that they would be in without these eased requirements. The duty of the management board of a parent undertaking to provide information (section 290 (1) and (2) of the Commercial Code) at the general meeting to which the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated management report are submitted also extends to cover the situation of the group and the enterprises included in the consolidated financial statements.</p><p><a name="p0889"><!----></a>(1a) In the case of the virtual general meeting, subsection (1) sentence 1 is to be applied subject to the proviso that the management board may stipulate that questions by the stockholders are to be submitted by way of electronic communication no later than three days prior to the general meeting.

In the case of listed companies, the questions are to be made accessible and the answers are to be provided via the company&#8217;s website. Section 126 (2) sentence 1 no. 1, 3 and 6 applies accordingly to the accessibility of the questions. If the answers have been continuously accessible one day prior to commencement of the general meeting and while the meeting is ongoing, the management board may refuse, at the meeting, to provide information regarding those questions.</p><p><a name="p0892"><!----></a>(1d) Each stockholder participating in the general meeting by electronic means is to be granted a right, by way of electronic communication, to ask follow-up questions regarding all of the answers provided by the management board before the meeting and while it is ongoing. Subsection (2) sentence 2 applies also to the right to ask follow-up questions.</p><p><a name="p0893"><!----></a>(1e) Moreover, each stockholder participating in the general meeting by electronic means is to be granted the right, by way of electronic communication, to ask questions regarding facts and circumstances that have come about only after the time limit defined in subsection (1a) sentence 1 has expired.

In the case of the virtual general meeting, it is to be warranted that each stockholder participating in the general meeting by electronic means is able to transmit their demand under sentence 1 by way of electronic communication. The management board may not refuse to provide the information in accordance with subsection (3) sentence 1 nos. 1 to 4. Sentences 1 to 3 do not apply if a subsidiary undertaking (section 290 (1) and (2) of the Commercial Code), a joint venture (section 310 (1) of the Commercial Code) or an associated enterprise (section 311 (1) of the Commercial Code) issues the information to a parent undertaking (section 290 (1) and (2) of the Commercial Code) for purposes of including the company in the consolidated financial statements of the parent undertaking and the information is required for this purpose.</p><p><a name="p0906"><!----></a>(5) Where a stockholder is denied the information sought, the stockholder may demand that their question and the grounds for refusing to provide the information be included in the minutes of the meeting.

In the case of the virtual general meeting, the following stockholders participating in the meeting by electronic means are entitled to file a petition:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0910"><!----></a>1.  any stockholder to whom the information demanded has not been provided,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0911"><!----></a>2.  any stockholder who has lodged an objection by way of electronic communication, if a resolution has been adopted regarding the item of business set out in the agenda to which the information pertained.</p><p><a name="p0912"><!----></a>The petition is to be filed within two weeks after the general meeting at which it was refused to provide the information sought.</p><p><a name="p0913"><!----></a>(3) Section 99 (1) and (3) sentences 1 and 2 as well as sentences 4 to 6 and subsection (5) sentences 1 and 3 apply accordingly.

In the event that a stockholder owns several shares of stock, the by-laws of an unlisted company may limit the voting right by specifying a maximum amount or a set of threshold amounts. Furthermore, the by-laws may determine that those shares of stock are to be counted as belonging to the stockholder that belong to some other party for the stockholder&#8217;s account. In the case of the stockholder being an enterprise, the by-laws may further determine that those shares of stock are to be counted as shares of stock belonging to the stockholder that belong to an enterprise controlled by the stockholder or an enterprise controlling the stockholder or an enterprise affiliated with the stockholder in a group of companies, or that belong to a third party for the account of such enterprises. The restrictions may not be imposed for individual stockholders. The restrictions are not to be taken into account in calculating a majority ratio of capital required by law or the by-laws.</p><p><a name="p0922"><!----></a>(2) The voting right commences upon the contribution having been made in full. Where the value of a hidden contribution in kind does not correspond to the value set out in section 36a (2) sentence 3, this does not conflict with the commencement of the voting right; this does not apply to obvious differences in value. The by-laws may stipulate that the voting right commences upon the statutory minimum contribution having been made, or whichever higher minimum contribution is specified in the by-laws. In such event, making the minimum contribution grants one vote; in the case of higher contributions, the proportion of votes is governed by the amount of the contributions made. Where the by-laws do not stipulate that the voting right commences prior to the contribution having been made in full, and where the contribution has not yet been made in full for any share of stock, the proportion of votes is governed by the amount of the contributions made; in this context, making the minimum contribution grants one vote. Fractions of votes are to be taken into account in these cases only insofar as they result in full votes for the stockholder entitled to vote. The by-laws may not make any provisions pursuant to this subsection for individual stockholders or for individual classes of stock.</p><p><a name="p0923"><!----></a>(3) The voting right may be exercised by an authorised representative. Where the stockholder authorises more than one person, the company may refuse to accept one or several of these proxies. The granting of the power of attorney, its revocation and the proof regarding the authorisation to be submitted to the company all must be in text form, unless stipulated otherwise in the by-laws or in the invitation convening the general meeting based on an authorisation set out in the by-laws, and unless eased requirements have been established in the case of listed companies. At a minimum, the listed company is to offer a means of electronic communication for transmitting proof. Where representatives exercising voting rights who have been named by the company are authorised, the company is to keep a verifiable record of the declaration of power of attorney for three years; section 135 (5) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0924"><!----></a>(4) The by-laws govern the form in which the voting right is exercised.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0925">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0925"><!----></a>Section 134a<br />Definitions; scope of application</p><p><a name="p0926"><!----></a>(1) As defined in sections 134b to 135,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0927"><!----></a>1.  an institutional investor is:</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0928"><!----></a>a)  an undertaking authorised to carry on life insurance business within the meaning of section 8 (1) read in conjunction with Annex 1 no. 19 to 24 of the Insurance Supervisory Act,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0929"><!----></a>b)  an undertaking authorised to carry on reinsurance business within the meaning of section 8 (1) and (4) of the Insurance Supervisory Act, insofar as these activities relate to obligations under life insurance,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0930"><!----></a>c)  an institution for occupational retirement provision pursuant to sections 232 to 244d of the Insurance Supervisory Act;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0931"><!----></a>2.  an asset manager is:</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0932"><!----></a>a)  a financial services institution authorised to provide portfolio management services within the meaning of section 1 (1a) sentence 2 no. 3 of the Banking Act,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0933"><!----></a>b)  a securities institution authorised to provide portfolio management services within the meaning of section 2 (2) no. 9 of the Act on the Supervision of Securities Institutions (<i>Wertpapierinstitutsgesetz</i> &#8211; WpIG)</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0934"><!----></a>c)  a capital management company authorised in accordance with section 20 (1) of the Investment Code;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0935"><!----></a>3.  a proxy adviser is:</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0936"><!----></a>an undertaking analysing disclosures and other information provided by listed companies, on a commercial basis and for monetary consideration, in order to inform investors by its research, consultancy services or voting recommendations for purposes of their exercising their voting rights.</p><p><a name="p0937"><!----></a>(2) For institutional investors, asset managers and proxy advisers, sections 134b to 135 apply only insofar as they are subject to the following provisions of Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the exercise of certain rights of shareholders in listed companies (OJ L 184 of 14 July 2007, p. 17), last amended by Directive (EU) 2017/828 (OJ L 132 of 20 May 2017, p. 1):</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0938"><!----></a>1.  for institutional investors: Article 1 (2) (a) and (6) (a),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0939"><!----></a>2.  for asset managers: Article 1 (2) (a) and (6) (b), and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0940"><!----></a>3.  for proxy advisers: Article 1 (2) (b) and (6) (c) as well as Article 3j (4).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0941">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0941"><!----></a>Section 134b<br />Engagement policy, engagement report, voting behaviour</p><p><a name="p0942"><!----></a>(1) Institutional investors and asset managers are to disclose a policy in which they describe their engagement in the investee companies (engagement policy), and in which the following items are addressed in particular:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0943"><!----></a>1.  how shareholder rights are exercised, in particular in the context of their investment strategy,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0944"><!----></a>2.  how investee companies are monitored on relevant matters,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0945"><!----></a>3.  how opinions are shared with the companies&#8217; organs and the stakeholders of the companies,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0946"><!----></a>4.  how they cooperate with other stockholders, as well as</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0947"><!----></a>5.  how conflicts of interest are managed.</p><p><a name="p0948"><!----></a>(2) Institutional investors and asset managers are to publicly disclose, on an annual basis, how their engagement policy has been implemented.

The power of attorney may only be granted to a specified intermediary, which must keep a verifiable record of it. The declaration of power of attorney must be complete and may only set out declarations connected to the exercise of the voting right. Where the stockholder does not issue any express instructions, a general power of attorney may provide only that the intermediary is authorised to exercise the voting right:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0981"><!----></a>1.  in accordance with its own vote guidance (subsections (2) and (3)) or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0982"><!----></a>2.  in accordance with guidance from the management board or from the supervisory board or, in the case of the guidance from the management board deviating from that of the supervisory board, in accordance with guidance from the supervisory board (subsection (4)).</p><p><a name="p0983"><!----></a>Where the intermediary offers to exercise the voting right pursuant to sentence 4 no. 1 or no. 2, then it is to concurrently tender the service, within the scope of what reasonably can be expected of it and until revoked, of forwarding to an association of stockholders or to any other representative for whom the stockholder may opt, the documents required for exercising the voting right. The intermediary is to indicate to the stockholder on an annual basis the opportunities available for revoking the power of attorney at any point in time and to change the authorised representative; this indication is to be set out prominently in the communication. The issuance of instructions as regards the individual items of business set out in the agenda, the granting and revocation of a general power of attorney pursuant to sentence 4, and the award of a contract pursuant to sentence 5, including any changes thereto, are to be facilitated for the stockholder by providing them with a form sheet or an onscreen form.</p><p><a name="p0984"><!----></a>(2) An intermediary intending to exercise the voting right on the basis of a power of attorney pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 4 no. 1 is to make accessible to the stockholder, in due time, its own guidance for exercising the voting right as regards the individual items of business set out in the agenda. In developing this guidance, the intermediary is to be oriented by the interests of the stockholder and is to take organisational measures to ensure that no interests of other business units influence this guidance; it is to appoint a member of the management that is to supervise compliance with these duties as well as the due and proper exercise of the voting right and its documentation. In providing its guidance, the intermediary is to indicate that it will exercise the voting right in accordance with its own guidance unless the stockholder issues other instructions in due time. Where a member of the management board or an employee of the intermediary is a member of the company&#8217;s supervisory board or where a member of the management board or an employee of the company is a member of the intermediary&#8217;s supervisory board, the intermediary is to indicate this fact. The same applies if the intermediary holds an ownership interest in the company that section 33 of the Securities Trading Act requires to be registered or if it was a member of a consortium that has assumed the last issuance, in terms of time, of securities of the company made in the past five years.</p><p><a name="p0985"><!----></a>(3) Where the stockholder has not issued any instructions to the intermediary on how to exercise the voting right, then the intermediary is to exercise the voting right, in the case governed by subsection (1) sentence 4 no. 1 in accordance with its own guidance, unless it is in its rights to assume, based on the circumstances, that, were the stockholder aware of the facts and circumstances, the stockholder would endorse the voting rights being exercised in derogation from the intermediary&#8217;s guidance. Where the intermediary has deviated, in exercising the voting right, from instructions issued by the stockholder or, if the stockholder has not issued any instructions, where the intermediary has deviated from its own guidance, it is to inform the stockholder of this fact while citing the grounds for doing so. At its own general meeting, the intermediary to which power of attorney has been granted may exercise the voting right conferred upon it by the power of attorney only insofar as the stockholder has issued express instructions concerning the individual items of business set out in the agenda. The same applies during the general meeting of a company in which the intermediary holds more than 20 per cent, directly or indirectly, of the capital stock; in computing the level of a holding, indirect holdings within the meaning of section 35 (3) to (6) of the Securities Trading Act are not to be taken into account.</p><p><a name="p0986"><!----></a>(4) An intermediary intending to exercise at a general meeting the voting right based on a power of attorney pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 4 no. 2 must make accessible to the stockholders the guidance issued by the management board and the supervisory board, unless this is effected in some other manner. Subsection (2) sentence 3 as well as subsection (3) sentences 1 to 3 apply accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0987"><!----></a>(5) Where the power of attorney so permits, the intermediary may grant sub-power of attorney to persons who are not its employees. Unless specified otherwise by the power of attorney, the intermediary exercises the voting right on behalf of the party entitled to such voting right. Where the company has permitted absentee balloting, the intermediary having been granted power of attorney may avail itself of this option. In order to provide the company with proof of its authorisation to vote, it suffices, in the case of listed companies, to submit proof of authorisation pursuant to section 123 (3); in all other cases, the requirements set out in the by-laws for exercising the voting right are to be met.</p><p><a name="p0988"><!----></a>(6) An intermediary may exercise the voting right for registered shares of stock that do not belong to it, but regarding which it is entered in the share register as holder, only based on an authorisation.

At a maximum, the multiple voting rights may amount to 10 times the voting right defined in section 134 (1) sentence 1. A resolution adopted by the general meeting to allot multiple voting rights to shares of stock or to issue multiple-vote shares requires the consent of all stockholders affected.</p><p><a name="p0995"><!----></a>(2) In the case of listed companies, and also in the case of companies whose shares of stock are included for trading on the regulated unofficial market in accordance with section 48 of the Stock Exchange Act (<i>Börsengesetz</i>), the multiple voting rights will expire in the event of the share of stock being transferred. They will expire no later than 10 years after the company has been listed on the stock exchange or after the shares of stock are included for trading on the regulated unofficial market unless the by-laws stipulate a shorter period of time. The time limit provided for in sentence 2 may be extended in the by-laws by a certain time limit of up to 10 years. The resolution on the extension may be adopted at the earliest one year prior to expiry of the time limit defined in sentence 2 and requires a majority comprising, at a minimum, three quarters of the capital stock represented at the time such resolution is adopted. The by-laws may stipulate a greater majority ratio of capital. Where several classes of stock exist of shares with voting rights, the resolution adopted by the general meeting requires the consent of the stockholders of each class of stock in order to enter into force. The stockholders of each class of stock are to adopt a separate resolution regarding such consent. Sentences 4 und 5 apply to such separate resolution.</p><p><a name="p0996"><!----></a>(3) The by-laws may impose further requirements.</p><p><a name="p0997"><!----></a>(4) In the case of resolutions on matters defined in section 119 (1) no. 5 and in section 142 (1), multiple-vote shares entitle to one vote only.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0998">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0998"><!----></a>Section 136<br />Suspension of the voting right</p><p><a name="p0999"><!----></a>(1) No-one may exercise the voting right for themselves or for some other party if the resolution to be adopted concerns the question of whether their actions are to be approved and they are to be granted discharge or whether they are to be released from a liability or whether it is intended to have the company assert a claim against them.

The management board is to submit the report to the supervisory board and is to give notice of it in the invitation convening the next general meeting as an item of business set out in the agenda.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1044">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1044"><!----></a>Section 146<br />Costs</p><p><a name="p1045"><!----></a>Where the court appoints special auditors, the company is to bear the court costs and the costs of the audit.

The claim to compensation as a rule is to be asserted within six months of the date of the general meeting.</p><p><a name="p1048"><!----></a>(2) The general meeting may appoint special representatives for the purpose of asserting the claim to compensation. Upon the corresponding petition being filed by stockholders whose shares of stock, in the aggregate, are at least equivalent to one tenth of the capital stock or to a stake in same of 1 million euros, the court (section 14) is to appoint persons as representatives of the company for the purpose of asserting the claim to compensation other than the persons appointed as representatives of the company pursuant to sections 78 and 112 or pursuant to sentence 1 of this provision, if the court holds that this is suitable for the proper assertion of such claims. Where the court finds for the petitioner, the company will bear the court costs. A complaint may be lodged against the decision taken. The court-appointed representatives may demand reimbursement from the company for their reasonable cash expenditures and remuneration for their activities. The court establishes the expenditures and the remuneration. A complaint may be lodged against the decision taken; filing a complaint on points of law is precluded. Based on the decision taken, compulsory enforcement can be pursued in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p><a name="p1049"><!----></a>(3) (repealed)</p><p><a name="p1050"><!----></a>(4) (repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1051">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1051"><!----></a>Section 148<br />Proceedings for leave to bring an action</p><p><a name="p1052"><!----></a>(1) Stockholders, whose shares of stock, in the aggregate, are at least equivalent to one hundredth of the capital stock or to a stake in same of 100,000 euros, at the point in time at which the petition is filed, may file a petition for leave to assert, in their own name, the company&#8217;s claims to compensation set out in section 147 (1) sentence 1. The court will permit such an action to be brought if:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1053"><!----></a>1.  the stockholders provide proof that they have purchased the shares of stock prior to the point in time at which they or, in the case of universal succession, their predecessors in title had reason to become aware, due to a publication, of the alleged derelictions of duties or the alleged damage;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1054"><!----></a>2.  the stockholders provide proof that they have called on the company to itself bring an action, setting a reasonable time limit, but that this was to no avail;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1055"><!----></a>3.  facts exist justifying the suspicion that the company may have suffered damage by dishonest conduct or gross violations of the law or the by-laws; and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1056"><!----></a>4.  no overriding grounds in terms of the company&#8217;s best interests conflict with the assertion of the claim to compensation.</p><p><a name="p1057"><!----></a>(2) That regional court in the judicial district of which the company has its seat decides on the petition for leave to bring an action by handing down a court order. Where a division for commercial matters has been formed at the regional court, this will take the decision instead of the civil division. Where this serves to ensure uniform adjudication, the <i>Land</i> government may transfer the decision, by a statutory instrument for the judicial districts of several regional courts, to one of the regional courts. The <i>Land</i> government may transfer the authorisation to the <i>Land </i>department of justice. The filing of the petition suspends the period of prescription applying to the claim that is the subject of the dispute until the petition has been dismissed and this dismissal has become final and binding or until the time limit set for bringing the action has expired. Prior to its decision, the court is to give the respondent the opportunity to state its position. The immediate complaint can be lodged against the decision. Filing a complaint on points of law is precluded. The company is to be summoned to attend the proceedings concerning leave to bring an action, and the proceedings concerning the action itself, as an interested third party whose rights may be affected.</p><p><a name="p1058"><!----></a>(3) The company is entitled to itself assert the claim to compensation before the courts at any point in time; upon the company bringing the action, any pending proceedings concerning leave to bring an action, or any pending proceedings concerning the action itself, that are pursued by stockholders regarding this claim to compensation will become inadmissible. The company is entitled, at its election, to accede to pending proceedings of the action concerning its claim to compensation in the status which the proceedings have reached at the time the company accedes to them. In the cases governed by sentences 1 and 2, the current petitioners or plaintiffs will be summoned to the proceedings as an interested third party whose rights may be affected.</p><p><a name="p1059"><!----></a>(4) Where the court has found for the petitioner, the action may only be brought before the court having jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (2) within three months of the decision having become final and binding and provided the stockholders have once again called on the company to itself bring an action, setting a reasonable time limit, but to no avail. The action is to be brought against the persons named in section 147 (1) sentence 1, demanding that performance be provided to the company. An intervention by the stockholders as joint parties no longer will be possible once leave has been granted to bring the action. Several actions are to be consolidated such that their hearings for oral argument and the decisions taken by the court coincide.</p><p><a name="p1060"><!----></a>(5) The judgment takes effect, even in those cases in which it dismisses the complaint, for and against the company and the remaining stockholders. This applies accordingly to any compromise of which notice is to be given by publication in accordance with section 149; however, it will take effect for and against the company only after leave has been granted to bring an action.</p><p><a name="p1061"><!----></a>(6) Insofar as the petition brought by the petitioner is dismissed, the petitioner is to bear the costs of the proceedings for leave to bring an action. If the dismissal is based on grounds contravening the action that concern the company&#8217;s best interests and that the company could have provided prior to the petition being filed, but failed to so provide, then the company is to reimburse the petitioner for the costs. In all other cases, the final judgment is to allocate the costs. Where the company itself brings an action, or where it accedes to pending proceedings of an action brought by stockholders, it is to bear any costs the petitioner may have incurred up until the point in time at which the company brought the action or acceded to the proceedings; the company may withdraw the action only subject to the pre-requisites set out in section 93 (4) sentences 3 and 4, to the exception of the blocking period. Where the action is dismissed, as a whole or in part, the company is to reimburse the plaintiffs for the costs they are to bear, unless the plaintiffs have obtained leave to bring an action by intentionally or grossly negligently making inaccurate submissions to the court. Stockholders acting jointly as petitioners or as joined parties will be reimbursed overall only for the costs of one authorised representative, unless involving a further authorised representative was indispensable for bringing the action.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1062">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1062"><!----></a>Section 149<br />Notices published regarding a liability action</p><p><a name="p1063"><!----></a>(1) Once leave has been granted to bring an action pursuant to section 148 and this leave has become final and binding, the listed company is to give notice, without undue delay, of the petition requesting leave and of the termination of the proceedings in the company&#8217;s publications of record.</p><p><a name="p1064"><!----></a>(2) The notice as to the proceedings having been terminated is to set out the nature of the proceedings, all agreements connected to it, including any collateral agreements made, citing their full wording as well as the names of the parties involved.

Where the annual financial statements or the consolidated financial statements are to be audited by a statutory auditor, said statutory auditor is to participate in the deliberations of the supervisory board or of the audit committee regarding the documents submitted and is to report on the substantial results of their audit, in particular on any findings they have made regarding key weaknesses of the internal control system and of the risk management system as concerns the accounting process. The statutory auditor informs on any circumstances giving rise to the concern that they might be biased and regarding any performance they have provided in addition to auditing the accounts. If a separate non-financial report (section 289b of the Commercial Code), a separate consolidated non-financial report (section 315b of the Commercial Code), the report on income tax information (sections 342b, 342c, 342d (2) no. 2 of the Commercial Code) and the declaration in accordance with section 342d (2) no. 1 of the Commercial Code has been prepared, the supervisory board is to audit such report as well.</p><p><a name="p1154"><!----></a>(2) The supervisory board is to report in writing to the general meeting on the result of the audit.

Where the annual financial statements are to be audited by a statutory auditor, the supervisory board is to furthermore state its position regarding the result of the audit of the annual financial statements performed by the statutory auditor. At the conclusion of the report, the supervisory board is to declare whether, as a consequence of the conclusive result of its audit, exception is to be taken and whether it endorses the annual financial statements drawn up by the management board. In the case of parent undertakings (section 290 (1) and (2) of the Commercial Code), sentences 3 and 4 apply accordingly to the consolidated financial statements.</p><p><a name="p1155"><!----></a>(3) The supervisory board is to forward its report within one month of having received the documents submitted to it to the management board.

If the report is not forwarded to the management board prior to expiry of this further time limit, then the annual financial statements will be considered to not have been endorsed by the supervisory board; in the case of parent undertakings (section 290 (1) and (2) of the Commercial Code), the same applies regarding the consolidated financial statements.</p><p><a name="p1156"><!----></a>(4) Subsections (1) to (3) apply also as regards standalone financial statements pursuant to section 325 (2a) of the Commercial Code.

The by-laws may stipulate a greater majority ratio of capital and may impose further requirements.

The invalidation is subject to the pre-requisite of notice of the call having been given by publication in the manner stipulated in section 64 (2) for the period of grace. The invalidation will be effected by notice in the company&#8217;s publications of record.

Notice of the time and location of the sale at public auction as well as the items to be sold at same is to be given by publication. The parties involved are to be notified separately; such notification may be forgone if it is not expedient. The notice by publication must be made and the notification must be issued no later than two weeks prior to the sale at public auction. The proceeds are to be paid out to the parties involved or, should a right to deposit exist, to be so deposited.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1411">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1411"><!----></a>Section 227<br />Application for registration of the implementation</p><p><a name="p1412"><!----></a>(1) The management board is to file an application for entry in the Commercial Register of the fact that the reduction of the capital stock has been implemented.</p><p><a name="p1413"><!----></a>(2) The application for registration of the implementation of the reduction of the capital stock and the entry of this fact in the register may be tied to the application for registration of the resolution adopted as to the reduction and its entry in the register.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1414">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1414"><!----></a>Section 228<br />Reduction below the minimum nominal amount</p><p><a name="p1415"><!----></a>(1) The capital stock may be reduced to an amount below the minimum nominal amount stipulated by section 7 if this amount is once again reached by a capital increase that is resolved upon concurrently with the capital reduction and in the context of which no contributions in kind have been specified.</p><p><a name="p1416"><!----></a>(2) The resolutions are null and void if they, and the implementation of the increase, have not been entered in the Commercial Register within six months following the resolution having been adopted.

This order has as its consequence that the beneficiary of same also will need to pay the fees charged by its lawyers only based on that part of the value of the matter in dispute. Inasmuch as costs of the legal dispute are imposed on the party or inasmuch as it accepts to bear such costs, it is to reimburse the court fees paid by its opponent and the fees of the opponent&#8217;s attorneys only based on the part of the value of the matter in dispute.

A control agreement must guarantee to the external stockholders, unless the company is also under obligation to remit its entire profits, a specified annual participation in the profits as appropriate compensation, in keeping with the amount determined for the payment of compensation.

Where the other contracting party is a stock corporation or a public partly limited partnership, that amount may be committed to, as compensation payment, that accrues to the shares of stock in the other company in each case as a participation in the profits, based on an appropriate conversion ratio. The appropriateness of the conversion is determined based on the ratio in which shares of stock of the other company would have to be allotted to one share of stock of the company in the case of a merger.</p><p><a name="p1894"><!----></a>(3) An agreement providing for no compensation at all, in contravention of subsection (1), is null and void. An action for avoidance of the resolution adopted by the general meeting of the company to consent to the agreement or to its amendment pursuant to section 295 (2) may not be based on section 243 (2) or on the fact that the compensation determined in the agreement is not a fair equivalent. Where the compensation determined in the agreement is not a fair equivalent, the court determined in section 2 of the Act on Valuation Proceedings under Corporate Law (<i>Spruchverfahrensgesetz</i> &#8211; SpruchG) is to determine, upon a corresponding petition having been filed, the compensation contractually owed; if, in this context, the agreement provides for the compensation to be calculated pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 2, then the court is to determine the compensation pursuant to this provision.</p><p><a name="p1895"><!----></a>(4) Where the court determines the compensation, the other contracting party may terminate the agreement within two months of the decision having become final and binding without observing any period of notice.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1896">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1896"><!----></a>Section 305<br />Settlement payment</p><p><a name="p1897"><!----></a>(1) Except for the obligation to provide compensation pursuant to section 304, a control agreement or a profit and loss absorption agreement must include the obligation of the other contracting party, upon a corresponding demand being made by an external stockholder, to purchase the latter&#8217;s shares of stock in return for an appropriate settlement payment determined in the agreement.</p><p><a name="p1898"><!----></a>(2) The agreement must provide for the following as settlement payment:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1899"><!----></a>1.  where the other contracting party is a stock corporation or public partly limited partnership, which is not controlled by another company, in which no majority ownership interest is held and which has its seat in a Member State of the European Union or in another state party to the Agreement creating the European Economic Area: the allotment of own shares in this company,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1900"><!----></a>2.  where the other contracting party is a stock corporation or public partly limited partnership controlled by another company or in which a majority ownership interest is held, and the controlling enterprise is a stock corporation or public partly limited partnership having its seat in a Member State of the European Union or in another state party to the Agreement creating the European Economic Area: either the allotment of shares of stock in the controlling company or in the company holding a majority of the ownership interest, or a cash settlement,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1901"><!----></a>3.  in all other cases, a cash settlement.</p><p><a name="p1902"><!----></a>(3) If shares of stock in some other company are allotted by way of settlement payment, then the settlement payment is to be deemed appropriate if the shares of stock are allotted in the ratio in which shares of stock in the other company would have to be allotted to one share of stock in the company in the case of a merger; in this context, compensation for indivisible residual amounts may be provided by additional cash payments. The appropriate cash settlement must take account of the company&#8217;s circumstances as given at the time its general meeting adopts the resolution regarding the agreement. It is to accrue interest from the expiry of that day onwards on which the control agreement or the profit and loss absorption agreement entered into force at five percentage points <i>per annum</i> above the respectively applicable basic rate of interest pursuant to section 247 of the Civil Code; the assertion of further-reaching damages is not precluded.</p><p><a name="p1903"><!----></a>(4) The obligation to purchase the shares of stock may be limited in time. At the earliest, the time limit ends two months following the date on which notice of the entry of the agreement&#8217;s existence in the Commercial Register pursuant to section 10 of the Commercial Code has been given by publication. Where a petition has been filed to have the court specified in section 2 of the Act on Valuation Proceedings under Corporate Law determine the compensation or the settlement payment, the time limit will end at the earliest two months following the day on which notice of the decision as to the last petition ruled on has been given by publication in the Federal Gazette.</p><p><a name="p1904"><!----></a>(5) The action for avoidance of the resolution adopted by the general meeting of the company to consent to the agreement or to its amendment pursuant to section 295 (2) may not be based on the fact that the settlement payment provided for in the agreement is not appropriate. Should the agreement not provide for any settlement payment at all, or a settlement payment that does not comply with subsections (1) to (3), the court specified in section 2 of the Act on Valuation Proceedings under Corporate Law will determine, upon a corresponding petition having been filed, the settlement payment that is to be granted under the agreement. In the cases governed by subsection (2) no. 2, and where the agreement provides for the allotment of shares of stock in the controlling company or in the company holding a majority of the ownership interest, the court in this context is to determine the ratio in which such shares of stock are to be allotted, and if the agreement does not provide for the allotment of shares of stock in the controlling company or in the company holding a majority of the ownership interest, the court is to determine the appropriate cash settlement. Section 304 (4) applies accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1905">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1905"><!----></a>Section 306<br />(repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1906">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1906"><!----></a>Section 307<br />Termination of the agreement in order to provide security to external stockholders</p><p><a name="p1907"><!----></a>If, at the time the resolution is adopted by its general meeting regarding a control agreement or a profit and loss absorption agreement, the company does not have an external stockholder, the agreement will end at the latest as per the end of the financial year in which an external stockholder holds an ownership interest.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1908">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1908"><!----></a>Part 2<br />Power of direction as well as liability and responsibilities in the case of controlled enterprises</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1909">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1909"><!----></a>Division 1<br />Power of direction as well as liability and responsibilities in the case of a control agreement</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1910">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1910"><!----></a>Section 308<br />Power of direction</p><p><a name="p1911"><!----></a>(1) Where a control agreement has been concluded, the controlling enterprise is entitled to issue directions to the management board of the company as regards the management of the company.

Where no such declaration is available, the integration may not be registered unless the stockholders entitled to bring an action declare, by a notarially recorded declaration of waiver, that they waive bringing an action against the entry into force of the resolution adopted by the general meeting.</p><p><a name="p1983"><!----></a>(6) It is equivalent to the declaration stipulated by subsection (5) sentence 1 if, once an action has been brought against the entry into force of a resolution adopted by a general meeting, the court has established by a court order, upon the petition having been filed by that company against whose resolution adopted by the general meeting the action is directed, that the fact of the action having been filed does not conflict with the entry in the register. Unless stipulated otherwise, section 247, sections 82, 83 (1) and section 84 of the Code of Civil Procedure as well as the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to proceedings of first instance before the regional courts are to be applied accordingly to the proceedings. A court order pursuant to sentence 1 is delivered if:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1984"><!----></a>1.  the action is inadmissible or manifestly unfounded,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1985"><!----></a>2.  the plaintiff has failed to provide proof by submitting the corresponding records and documents, within one week of having served the petition, that they have been holding a stake of at least 1,000 euros since the notice convening the assembly was published or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1986"><!----></a>3.  the prompt entering into force of the resolution adopted by the general meeting appears to take precedence because the court holds, at its discretion and conviction, that the substantial disadvantages for the company and its stockholders as presented by the petitioner outweigh the disadvantages the respondent stands to suffer; this does not apply if the violation of the law is particularly grave.</p><p><a name="p1987"><!----></a>In urgent cases, the court order may be delivered without a hearing for oral argument being held. The court order as a rule is to be delivered no later than three months after the petition has been filed; the reasons for any delays to the decision are to be provided in a court order against which there is no right of appeal. The facts and circumstances brought before the court, by reason of which the court order pursuant to sentence 3 may be delivered, are to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court. A senate of the higher regional court in the judicial district of which the company has its seat will decide regarding the petition. Transferring the matter to a judge sitting alone is precluded; no conciliation hearing is required. There is no right of appeal against the court order. If the action is found to be well-founded, then the company that has obtained the court order will be under obligation to compensate the respondent for the damages that the latter has suffered as a result of the integration based on the resolution adopted by the general meeting having been registered. Once it has been registered, any deficiencies of the resolution will not affect its implementation; no demand may be made to cancel the effects of entering the resolution in the register, also not by way of compensation of damages.</p><p><a name="p1988"><!----></a>(7) Upon entry of the integration in the Commercial Register kept at the seat of the company, the company will have been integrated into the principal company.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1989">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1989"><!----></a>Section 320<br />Integration by a resolution of the majority</p><p><a name="p1990"><!----></a>(1) The general meeting of a stock corporation may resolve to integrate the company into some other stock corporation having its seat within Germany also in those cases in which the shares of stock in the company making up, in the aggregate, 95 per cent of the capital stock, are held by the future principal company. Treasury shares of stock and shares of stock held by some other party for the account of the company are not to be included in determining the capital stock.

The integration report also is to explain and justify, in legal and economic terms, the nature and amount of the settlement payment pursuant to section 320b; any particular difficulties encountered in valuing the companies involved as well as the consequences for the ownership interest held by the stockholders are to be indicated.

Shares of stock in the principal company are to be allotted to them as settlement payment. If the principal company is a controlled company, then, at the election of the former stockholders, either treasury shares of stock in the principal company are to be allotted to them or an appropriate cash settlement is to be paid. Where shares of stock in the principal company are allotted by way of a settlement payment, the settlement payment is considered appropriate if the shares of stock are allotted in the ratio in which shares of stock in the principal company would have to be allotted to one share of stock in the company in the case of a merger; in this context, compensation for indivisible residual amounts may be provided by additional cash payments. The cash settlement must take account of the company&#8217;s circumstances as given at the time its general meeting adopts the resolution regarding the integration. The cash settlement as well as the additional cash payments are to accrue interest, from the time at which notice of the entry is given by publication, at five (5) percentage points per annum above the respectively applicable basic rate of interest pursuant to section 247 of the Civil Code; the assertion of further-reaching damages is not precluded.</p><p><a name="p2002"><!----></a>(2) The action for avoidance of the resolution adopted by the general meeting of the integrated company by which it resolved on the integration may not be based on section 243 (2) or on the fact that the settlement payment offered by the principal company pursuant to section 320 (2) no. 2 is not appropriate. Where the settlement payment offered is not appropriate, the court specified in section 2 of the Act on Valuation Proceedings under Corporate Law is to establish, upon a corresponding petition having been filed, the appropriate settlement payment. The same applies if the principal company has not offered any settlement payment, or has not offered it duly and properly, and no action for avoidance based on that fact has been brought within the period for avoidance, or the action for avoidance has been retracted or has been dismissed in a final and binding manner.</p><p><a name="p2003"><!----></a>(3) (repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2004">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2004"><!----></a>Section 321<br />Protection of creditors</p><p><a name="p2005"><!----></a>(1) Security is to be provided to those of the creditors of the integrated company whose claims have arisen prior to notice by publication having been made as to the integration&#8217;s having been entered in the Commercial Register, provided they come forward for this purpose within six months of the notice by publication, unless they are able to demand satisfaction of their claims.
