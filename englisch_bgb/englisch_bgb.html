In the case of a financed acquisition of a plot of land or of an equivalent right, an economic unit is to be assumed only if the lender itself provides the plot of land or the equivalent right to the consumer, or if the lender, beyond the provision of the loan, promotes the acquisition of the plot of land or the equivalent right in cooperation with the trader, by adopting as its own the interest of the trader in alienating the plot, as a whole or in part, by assuming functions of the alienating party in planning, advertising or carrying out the project, or by unilaterally favouring the alienating party.</p><p><a name="p1551"><!----></a>(4) Section 355 (3) and, depending on the type of the linked contract, sections 357 to 357b are to be applied accordingly to the winding up of the linked contract, independently of the type of sale.

Where the linked contract is a contract for delivery by instalments that is a distance contract or an off-premises contract, section 357 also is to be applied accordingly, besides section 355 (3); in all other cases, section 355 (3) and section 357c apply accordingly to linked contracts for the delivery by instalments. In the case of subsection (1), however, claims against the consumer for payment of interest and costs arising from the winding up of the credit agreement are excluded.

Insofar as in accordance with the type of contract there is no net loan amount (section 491 (2) sentence 2 no. 1), it is replaced by the cash payment price or, if the trader has acquired the object for the consumer, by the acquisition price.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2209">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2209"><!----></a>Section 507<br />Instalment payment transactions</p><p><a name="p2210"><!----></a>(1) Section 494 subsections (1) to (3) and subsection (6) sentence 2 second half-sentence, is not to be applied to instalment payment transactions. If the consumer submits their offer to conclude a contract in distance selling on the basis of a sales prospectus or of a comparable electronic medium, from which the cash payment price, the borrowing rate, the effective annual interest rate, a redemption plan based on example total amounts, as well as the securities to be provided and insurance are evident, section 492 (1) also is not to be applied if the trader informs the consumer of the content of the contract on a durable medium at the latest without undue delay following conclusion of the contract.</p><p><a name="p2211"><!----></a>(2) The instalment payment transaction is void if the requirement as to written form in section 492 (1) is not observed or if one of the items of information required by Article 247 sections 6, 12, and 13 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code (<i>Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche</i>) is omitted in the contract. Notwithstanding a defect under sentence 1, the instalment payment transaction becomes valid if the thing is delivered to the consumer or the performance is rendered. However, the maximum rate of interest on the cash payment price is the statutory rate of interest if the information on the total amount or the effective annual rate of interest is missing. If a cash payment price is not stated, then in case of doubt the market price is deemed to be the cash payment price. If information on the effective annual rate of interest states a rate that is too low, the total amount is reduced by the percentage by which the effective annual rate of interest is too low.</p><p><a name="p2212"><!----></a>(3) In derogation from sections 491a and 492 (2) of the present Code, and in derogation from Article 247 sections 3, 6, and 12 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code (<i>Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche</i>), the cash payment price and the effective annual interest rate do not need to be stated in the pre-contractual information or in the contract if the trader delivers things or renders performance only against payments in instalments. In cases covered by section 501, the calculation of the cost reduction is to be based on the statutory interest rate (section 246). A right to compensation for early repayment of the loan is excluded.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2213">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2213"><!----></a>Section 508<br />Revocation with regard to instalment payment transactions</p><p><a name="p2214"><!----></a>The trader may revoke an instalment payment transaction by reason of default in payment by the consumer only if the prerequisites designated in section 498 (1) sentence 1 are met. The total amount corresponds to the nominal amount. The consumer also is to compensate the trader for the expenses incurred as a result of the contract. The reduction in value that has since occurred is to be taken into account in the calculation of remuneration for the emoluments of a thing to be returned. If the trader takes back the thing supplied under the instalment payment transaction, this is deemed an exercise of the right of revocation, unless the trader agrees with the consumer to pay the latter the usual market value of the thing at the time of its removal. Sentence 5 applies accordingly if a contract for the supply of a thing is linked to a consumer credit agreement (section 358 (3)) and if the lender takes the thing; in the case of rescission, the legal relationship between the lender and the consumer is governed by sentences 3 and 4.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2215">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2215"><!----></a>Section 509<br />(repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2216">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2216"><!----></a>Subtitle 3<br />Contracts for delivery by instalments between a trader and a consumer</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2217">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2217"><!----></a>Section 510<br />Contracts for delivery by instalments</p><p><a name="p2218"><!----></a>(1) The written form is required for the contract between a consumer and a trader if the contract</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p2219"><!----></a>1.  has as its subject matter the supply of more than one thing sold as belonging together by way of performance in instalments and remuneration is to be paid for the totality of the things in instalments, </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p2220"><!----></a>2.  has as its subject matter the periodic supply of things of the same kind, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p2221"><!----></a>3.  has as its subject matter the duty of recurrent acquisition or procurement of things.</p><p><a name="p2222"><!----></a>This does not apply if the consumer is given the opportunity to retrieve the terms of the contract, including the standard business terms, at conclusion of the contract, and to store them in a reproducible form.

This does not apply if the lease has been terminated or the lease ends in less than three years. The Agricultural Court may make its substitute permission subject to requirements and conditions, in particular by ordering that security be provided, and may specify the nature and extent of the security.

Where the contractor asserts internal processes within their operations as the reason for which the contractor cannot reasonably be required to comply with the order pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1, the burden of proof will be incumbent on the contractor.

Where the contractor opts to proceed in this manner and no court decision is handed down that stipulates otherwise, the additional remuneration owed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) will be due only following acceptance of the work.

Sentence 1 also applies in the same scope to claims replacing the remuneration. The claim of the contractor for a security is not ruled out by the customer being able to demand performance or of their having accepted the work. Claims with which the customer is able to set off against the contractor&#8217;s claim to remuneration are not taken into account in calculating the remuneration unless they are uncontested or have been finally and bindingly established. The security is to be deemed sufficient even if its provider reserves the right to withdraw their promise in case of a substantial deterioration of the financial circumstances of the customer, with effect for claims to remuneration for building work that the contractor has not yet performed when the declaration of revocation is received.</p><p><a name="p3232"><!----></a>(2) The security also may be provided by means of a guarantee or other promise of payment by a banking institution or credit insurer authorised to operate its business within the territorial extent of this Code.

The guarantor named in the contract under Article 250 section 6 2 no. 3 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code may not invoke, in relation to the traveller, either objections under the guarantor contract nor its termination if the termination was effected after conclusion of the package travel contract.

The payment service provider is obliged to unblock the payment instrument or to replace it with a new payment instrument once the reasons for blocking it no longer exist.

The information must be provided if possible before, but at the latest promptly after access is refused.

If the payer&#8217;s payment service provider proves that the payment amount was received without deductions by the payee&#8217;s payment service provider, the liability under this subsection ceases to be given.</p><p><a name="p3780"><!----></a>(2) Where a payment transaction is initiated by or through the payee, the latter may demand from their payment service provider, in the event of the non-execution or of the incorrect execution of the payment order, that this payment order be transferred without undue delay, where necessary once again, to the payer&#8217;s payment service provider. If the payee&#8217;s payment service provider proves that they have met the obligations incumbent on them in implementing the payment transaction, the payer&#8217;s payment service provider is to refund to the payer, as the case may be without undue delay, the payment amount without deductions in accordance with subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2. Insofar as charges were deducted from the payment amount contrary to section 675q subsections (1) and (2), the payee&#8217;s payment service provider is to make available the deducted amount to the payee without undue delay.</p><p><a name="p3781"><!----></a>(3) Where a payment transaction is initiated by the payer, the payer may demand, in the case of their payment order being executed late, that their payment service provider raise the claim pursuant to sentence 2 against the payee&#8217;s payment service provider. The payer&#8217;s payment service provider may demand of the payee&#8217;s payment service provider that the payment amount be credited to the payee&#8217;s payment account as if the payment transaction had been duly and properly executed. Where a payment transaction is initiated by the payer via a payment initiation service provider, the obligation under sentence 1 is incumbent on the account servicing payment service provider. Where the payer&#8217;s payment service provider proves that the payment amount was received in due time by the payee&#8217;s payment service provider, the liability under this subsection ceases to be given.</p><p><a name="p3782"><!----></a>(4) Where a payment transaction is initiated by or via the payee, the payee may demand, in the event of the payment order being transmitted late, that their payment service provider credit the payment amount to the payee&#8217;s payment account as if the payment transaction had been executed properly. Where the payee&#8217;s payment service provider proves that they have transmitted the payment order in due time to the payer&#8217;s payment service provider, the payer&#8217;s payment service provider is under obligation to refund to the payer, as the case may be without undue delay, the payment amount without any deductions in accordance with subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2. This does not apply if the payer&#8217;s payment service provider proves that the payment amount was merely received late by the payee&#8217;s payment service provider. In such event, the payee&#8217;s payment service provider is under obligation to credit the payment amount to the payee&#8217;s payment account in accordance with sentence 1.</p><p><a name="p3783"><!----></a>(5) Claims of the payment service user against their payment service provider under subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2 as well as under subsection (2) sentence 2 are deemed not to exist insofar as the payment order was implemented in accordance with the incorrect unique identifier stated by the payment service user. In this case, the payer may however demand from their payment service provider that the latter does their utmost to recover the payment amount. The payee&#8217;s payment service provider is under obligation to provide to the payer&#8217;s payment service provider all information that is required in order to recover the payment amount. Where it is impossible to recover the payment amount pursuant to sentences 2 and 3, the payer&#8217;s payment service provider is under obligation to provide to the payer, at the latter&#8217;s written application, all available information necessary to enable the payer to assert a claim to reimbursement of the payment amount. The payment service provider may agree on a charge with the payment service user in the framework contract on payment services for activities pursuant to sentences 2 to 4.</p><p><a name="p3784"><!----></a>(6) A payment service user may demand from their payment service provider, over and above the claims under subsections (1) and (2), that the charges and interest be refunded to them which the payment service provider invoiced to them in connection with the non-execution or incorrect execution of the payment transaction or which the payment service provider debited from their payment account.</p><p><a name="p3785"><!----></a>(7) If a payment order was not executed, or if it was executed incorrectly, the payment service provider of the payment service user who initiated a payment transaction, or through whom a payment transaction was initiated, is to subsequently trace, at the request of their payment service user, the payment transaction and inform their payment service user of the outcome.</p><p><a name="p3786"><!----></a>(8) Where a case governed by section 675d subsection (6) sentence 1 no. 1 (b) is given, section 675y subsection (1) to (4) is not to be applied to the components of a payment transaction that are effected within the European Economic Area. </p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p3787">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p3787"><!----></a>Section 675z<br />Other claims in case of non-execution, defective or late execution of a payment order or in case of an unauthorised payment transaction</p><p><a name="p3788"><!----></a>Sections 675u and 675y are final with regard to the claims of a payment service user provided for therein. The liability of a payment service provider towards their payment service user for a loss caused by non-execution or by the incorrect or late execution of a payment order which is not already covered by section 675y may be restricted to 12,500 euros; this does not apply to intent and gross negligence, to lost interest and to risks which the payment service provider separately has taken on. In this context, payment service providers are to assume as their own responsibility any responsibility that is attributed to an intermediary agency unless the main cause lies with an intermediary agency that the payment service user had stipulated. In cases governed by the exception made in sentence 3, the intermediary agency stipulated by the payment service user is liable in place of the payment service provider of the payment service user. Section 675y (5) sentence 1 is to be applied accordingly to the liability of a payment service provider under sentences 2 to 4. Where a case governed by section 675d (6) sentence 1 no. 1 (b) is given, section 675z sentence 3 is not to be applied to the components of a payment transaction that are effected within the European Economic Area.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p3789">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p3789"><!----></a>Section 676<br />Proof of execution of payment transactions</p><p><a name="p3790"><!----></a>If it is a matter of dispute between the payment service user and their payment service provider as to whether the payment transaction was executed properly, the payment service provider must prove that the payment transaction was recorded and posted properly, and not impaired by any malfunction.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p3791">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p3791"><!----></a>Section 676a<br />Equalisation claim</p><p><a name="p3792"><!----></a>(1) If the cause for the liability of a payment service provider under sections 675u, 675y and 675z lies within the sphere of responsibility of another payment service provider, a payment initiation service provider or of an intermediary agency, then the payment service provider may demand that the other payment service provider, the payment initiation service provider or the intermediary agency provide compensation for the damage the payment service provider has incurred by satisfying the claims of a payment service user under sections 675u, 675y and 675z.</p><p><a name="p3793"><!----></a>(2) If it is in dispute between the payer&#8217;s account servicing payment service provider and the payment initiation service provider whether or not a payment transaction that has been effected was authorised, the payment initiation service provider must prove that an authentication was performed within their sphere of responsibility and that the payment transaction was properly recorded and was not impaired by a disruption.</p><p><a name="p3794"><!----></a>(3) If it is in dispute between the payer&#8217;s account servicing payment service provider and the payment initiation service provider whether or not a payment transaction has been properly executed, the payment initiation service provider must prove that </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p3795"><!----></a>1.  the payment order was received by the account servicing payment service provider in accordance with section 675n, and that </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p3796"><!----></a>2.  the payment transaction was duly and properly recorded within the sphere of responsibility of the payment initiation service provider and was not impaired by a disruption.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p3797">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p3797"><!----></a>Section 676b<br />Notification of unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transactions</p><p><a name="p3798"><!----></a>(1) The payment service user is to notify their payment service provider without undue delay after learning of an unauthorised or defectively executed payment transaction.</p><p><a name="p3799"><!----></a>(2) Claims of the payment service user vis-à-vis the payment service provider and objections raised against them under this Subchapter are ruled out if the payment service user has failed to notify their payment service provider accordingly by no later than 13 months after the day on which their account has been debited with an unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transaction.

This also applies to wishes which the person under custodianship expressed before the appointment of the custodian, unless they discernibly do not wish to uphold these wishes. Before the custodian deals with important matters, they discuss them with the person under custodianship, to the extent that this is not inconsistent with the best interests of the latter.</p><p><a name="p7224"><!----></a>(4) Within their scope of functions, the custodian is to work towards opportunities being seized to alleviate or improve the illness or handicap of the person under custodianship, to prevent the exacerbation of the illness or handicap or to mitigate its consequences. If the custodianship is conducted as an occupation or profession, then where appropriate the custodian is to draw up, on the order of the court, a custodianship plan at the commencement of the custodianship. The custodianship plan is to set out the aims of the custodianship and the measures to be undertaken to achieve them.</p><p><a name="p7225"><!----></a>(5) If the custodian becomes aware of circumstances which enable the cancellation of the custodianship, they are to notify the custodianship court of this.
