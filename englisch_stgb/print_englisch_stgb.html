When making the order for placement in an addiction treatment facility in addition to imprisonment for a term of at least three years, the court is, as a rule, to order that a part of the sentence be enforced before the measure. That part of the sentence is to be calculated in a manner which enables a decision under subsection (5) sentence 1 to be made after the part of the sentence and the measure have been enforced. The court is, as a rule, to further determine that the sentence is to be enforced before the measure if the convicted person is required to leave the country and may be deported from the Federal Republic of Germany and if there is reason to believe that the convicted person&#8217;s residence within the territorial scope of this statute will be terminated whilst serving the sentence or immediately after the sentence has been served.</p><p><a name="p0481"><!----></a>(3) The court may subsequently make, modify or set aside an order under subsection (2) sentence 1 or 2 if that is deemed appropriate based on the convicted person&#8217;s circumstances. The court may also subsequently make the order under subsection (2) sentence 4. If it has made an order in accordance with subsection (2) sentence 4, it then revokes such order if there is reason to believe that the convicted person&#8217;s residence within the territorial scope of this statute will no longer be terminated whilst serving the sentence or immediately after the sentence has been served.</p><p><a name="p0482"><!----></a>(4) If the measure is enforced in full or in part before the sentence, the period of enforcement is credited against the sentence up to a maximum of two thirds of the penalty.</p><p><a name="p0483"><!----></a>(5) If the measure is enforced before the sentence or a remainder of the sentence, the court may suspend enforcement of the remainder of the sentence under the conditions of section 57 (1) sentences 1 and 2 if half of the sentence has been served. If the remainder of the sentence is not suspended, enforcement of the measure continues; the court may, however, order that the sentence be served if this is deemed appropriate based on the convicted person&#8217;s circumstances.</p><p><a name="p0484"><!----></a>(6) The court orders that any crediting in accordance with subsection (4) is also to be made in regard to a sentence arising from a separate criminal conviction if its enforcement would mean undue hardship for the convicted person. In particular, consideration is to be given, when taking this decision, to the relationship between the length of the previous deprivation of liberty and the length of the newly imposed sentence, the therapeutic success achieved thus far and the concrete danger the person poses, as well as that person&#8217;s conduct during enforcement. A measure is, as a rule, not credited against a sentence of the separate criminal conviction where the underlying offence has been committed after the measure was ordered. Subsection (5) sentence 2 applies accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0485">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0485"><!----></a>Section 67a<br />Transfer to another measure</p><p><a name="p0486"><!----></a>(1) If placement in a psychiatric hospital or in an addiction treatment facility has been ordered, the court may subsequently transfer the detained person to the other of those two measures if this would improve the chances of that person&#8217;s successful social rehabilitation.</p><p><a name="p0487"><!----></a>(2) Under the conditions of subsection (1), the court may also subsequently transfer a person subject to preventive detention to one of the measures referred to in subsection (1). Subsequent transfer may be ordered where the conditions of subsection (1) are met and the transfer is indicated for the purposes of carrying out medical or addiction treatment, including for those persons who are still serving a sentence of imprisonment and whose preventive detention has been ordered or reserved.</p><p><a name="p0488"><!----></a>(3) The court may modify or set aside a decision taken in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) if it subsequently transpires that this would improve the chances of the detained person&#8217;s successful social rehabilitation.

Any period during which the offender was detained in an institution by official order is not taken into account. The court orders enforcement if the purpose of the placement still so requires. If the purpose of the placement has not been achieved yet special circumstances justify the expectation that it may be achieved by suspending enforcement, the court suspends the measure on probation; the order for suspension automatically leads to the supervision of conduct. If the purpose of the measure has been achieved, the court declares it disposed of.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0499">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0499"><!----></a>Section 67d<br />Period of placement</p><p><a name="p0500"><!----></a>(1) The period of placement in an addiction treatment facility may not exceed two years. This term runs from the start of the measure. Where a measure involving deprivation of liberty is enforced before a sentence of imprisonment imposed at the same time, the maximum period is extended by the length of the term of imprisonment to the extent that the time spent in the measure is credited against the sentence.</p><p><a name="p0501"><!----></a>(2) If no maximum period is provided for or the period has not yet expired, the court suspends the remainder of the measure on probation if it is to be expected that the person subject to the measure will no longer commit any serious unlawful acts if released. The same applies if, after enforcement of preventive detention has begun, the court finds that its further enforcement would be disproportionate because the preventive detainee was not offered sufficient support within the meaning of section 66c (1) no. 1 before a period set by the court not exceeding six months has elapsed; if sufficient support was not offered, the court is to set such a period when reviewing the suspension of enforcement, indicating the measures to be offered. Suspension under sentence 1 or 2 automatically leads to the supervision of conduct.</p><p><a name="p0502"><!----></a>(3) Where 10 years of preventive detention have been served, the court declares the measure disposed of if there is no danger that the preventive detainee will commit further serious crimes resulting in severe emotional trauma or physical injury to the victims.

The measure is thus disposed of. Release from detention automatically leads to the supervision of conduct.</p><p><a name="p0504"><!----></a>(5) The court declares the placement in an addiction treatment facility disposed of where the conditions of section 64 sentence 2 are no longer met. Release from an addiction treatment facility automatically leads to the supervision of conduct.</p><p><a name="p0505"><!----></a>(6) If, after enforcement of placement in a psychiatric hospital has begun, the court finds that the conditions for the measure no longer exist or that continued enforcement of the measure would be disproportionate, the court declares it disposed of. Once the measure has lasted six years, its continuation is generally no longer proportionate, unless there is a danger that the detainee will, as a result of his or her condition, commit serious unlawful acts causing severe emotional trauma or physical injury to the victims or exposing the victims to the danger of severe physical injury or emotional trauma. After 10 years of detention, subsection (3) sentence 1 applies accordingly. Release from the measure automatically leads to the supervision of conduct. The court waives supervision of conduct if it is to be expected that the person will no longer commit any further offences even without the measure.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0506">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0506"><!----></a>Section 67e<br />Review</p><p><a name="p0507"><!----></a>(1) The court may at any time review whether further enforcement of the measure involving deprivation of liberty is to be suspended on probation or the measure is to be declared disposed of.

By providing advice and assistance, the counselling is intended to contribute to overcoming the conflict situation which exists in connection with the pregnancy and to remedying an emergency situation.
