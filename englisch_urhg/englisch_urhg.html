Sole jurisdiction for issuing any such order, regardless of the value of the claim, lies with the regional court in whose district the person obliged to provide information has his or her domicile, principal place of business or a place of business. The decision is rendered by the civil division. The provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-Contentious Jurisdiction (<i>Gesetz über das Verfahren in Familiensachen und in den Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit</i>) apply accordingly to the proceedings. The costs of the judicial order are borne by the injured party. The remedy of a complaint (<i>Beschwerde</i>) is admissible in respect of the regional court&#8217;s decision.
