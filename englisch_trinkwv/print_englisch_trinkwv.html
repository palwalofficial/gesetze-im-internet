The competent authority may order that the operator of a decentralised water supply system is required to comply with the obligation under sentence 1 if there are indications that parametric values for radioactive substances under section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I may be exceeded. The competent authority may order that the operator of an individual water supply system is required to conduct testing in relation to the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I if it deems this necessary to protect human health. When issuing the order as referred to in sentence 3, the competent authority determines in each instance which parameters are to be tested and the number of required tests.</p><p><a name="p0363"><!----></a>(2) Where drinking water is supplied from a centralised water supply system or a decentralised water supply system to another centralised or decentralised water supply system, the competent authority may determine which testing as required by subsection (1) is to be conducted in each case by the operator of which water supply system.</p><p><a name="p0364"><!----></a>(3) The initial testing serves to determine the annual average activity concentrations and to assess whether the parametric values for radioactive substances are being complied with. The initial testing is to be started within three months after commissioning of the water supply system. Where there are significant changes to water abstraction or water treatment which may have an adverse effect on the radionuclide content of the water, renewed initial testing is to be conducted within three months after the significant change.</p><p><a name="p0365"><!----></a>(4) The initial testing comprises four tests conducted in four different quarters within a one-year testing period. Drinking water testing which was conducted as part of monitoring within the meaning of section 57 may be counted towards the scope and the number of tests to be conducted as part of initial testing. The parametric value for radon-222 and tritium is deemed to have been complied with during initial testing if the average activity concentration measured over the testing period does not exceed the parametric value in question. The parametric value for the reference dose is deemed to be complied with if the average activity concentration measured in accordance with Annex 4 Parts II and III over the testing period proves that this value is not exceeded.</p><p><a name="p0366"><!----></a>(5) The activity concentration of radon-222 and the reference dose for natural radionuclides are to be determined during initial testing. It is only necessary to conduct initial testing of the drinking water in relation to the parametric value for tritium or other artificial radionuclides to determine the reference dose if the competent authority has ordered this on the basis of sentence 3 or 4. The competent authority may order that initial testing in relation to artificial radionuclides be conducted if there are indications that the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I may be exceeded. The authority is required to order that the reference dose be determined, taking account of artificial radionuclides, if the parametric value for tritium is exceeded.</p><p><a name="p0367"><!----></a>(6) Where initial testing establishes the exceedance of a parametric value for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I, regular testing of the drinking water is necessary in relation to that parametric value. This does not affect section 33 (2) no. 2. If the competent authority orders, in accordance with section 63 (1) sentence 1 in conjunction with section 62 (3), that the drinking water be treated to reduce the radionuclide content of the drinking water, then regular testing is to be conducted to check the ongoing efficacy of the water treatment.</p><p><a name="p0368"><!----></a>(7) Regular testing is to be conducted as from the year following that year in which initial testing was completed or after treatment measures were ordered in accordance with section 63 (1) sentence 1 in conjunction with section 62 (3). The number of regular tests which are to be conducted within a one-year period follows from Annex 6 Part II. Where the results of previous testing have shown that certain natural radionuclides are present in the water in stable activity concentrations, the competent authority may, depending on the local conditions, determine less frequent regular testing and adjust the scope of testing in relation to those natural radionuclides. Drinking water testing conducted in the context of monitoring within the meaning of section 57 may count towards the scope and frequency of regular testing.</p><p><a name="p0369"><!----></a>(8) The calculation and assessment of the reference dose and the performance characteristics for testing in relation to radioactive substances during initial testing and regular testing are governed by Annex 4 Parts II and III and Annex 7 Part II.</p><p style="text-align: left;
