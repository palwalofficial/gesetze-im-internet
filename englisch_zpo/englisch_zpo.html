A change of the authoritative amounts pursuant to section 115 (1), third sentence, number 1 lit. b and number 2 shall be taken into account only upon an application having been filed and only in those cases in which such change results in no monthly instalment needing to be paid. Should the court so demand, the party must disclose at any time whether or not its circumstances have changed.

The second sentence shall apply mutatis mutandis inasmuch as deductible obligations have ceased to exist.

A modification of the decision is ruled out when the party would have been granted assistance with court costs without having to make payments in instalments, had whatever the party obtained by the action brought or by the defence against an action brought against it been paid or provided in due time.</p><p><a name="p0478"><!----></a>(4) For its declaration regarding the change of its personal or economic circumstances pursuant to subsection (1), third sentence, the party must use the form introduced pursuant to section 117 (3).

The attachment of several monetary claims against various third-party debtors is to be ordered by a uniform court order, upon the creditor filing a corresponding petition, provided that this appears to be mandated for the enforcement purpose and further provided that there is no reason to assume that interests warranting protection of the third-party debtor would contravene this.</p><p><a name="p2984"><!----></a>(2) The creditor is to have the court order served on the third-party debtor.

The objection that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority is to be raised as soon as the matter regarding which this allegation is being made is addressed in the course of the arbitral proceedings.
