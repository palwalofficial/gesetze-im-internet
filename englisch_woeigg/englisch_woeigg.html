Each apartment owner shall have the right, as against a creditor, to raise all objections and defences to which he is personally entitled, as well as those to which the community of apartment owners is entitled, but not his objections and defences as against the community of apartment owners. Section 770 of the Civil Code shall apply <i>mutatis mutandis </i>in respect of the defences of voidability and set-off. The liability of an apartment owner towards the community of apartment owners in respect of improper administration shall be governed by the first sentence.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0070">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0070"><!----></a>Section 11<br />Indissolubility of the Community of Apartment Owners</p><p><a name="p0071"><!----></a>(1) No apartment owner shall have the right to demand the dissolution of the community of apartment owners.
