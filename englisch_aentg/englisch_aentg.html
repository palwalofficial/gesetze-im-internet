When determining such representativity, consideration is primarily to be given to</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0075"><!----></a>1.  the number of workers covered by the scope of application of the collective agreement who are employed by the respective employers bound by the collective agreement,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0076"><!----></a>2.  the number of members of the trade union which concluded the collective agreement who are covered by the scope of application of the respective collective agreement.</p><p><a name="p0077"><!----></a>(3) Where applications have been made for several collective agreements to be declared universally applicable, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is required to take especial care when weighing up those interests with constitutional status affected by the decision and to strike a careful balance between the competing basic rights.</p><p><a name="p0078"><!----></a>(4) Before issuing a statutory instrument, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs gives those employers and workers covered by the scope of application of that statutory instrument, the parties to the collective agreement and, in the cases referred to in subsection (2), the parties to other collective agreements, as well as commissions constituted on the basis of parity which lay down working conditions under canon law for the remit of church employers covered, at least in part, by the scope of application of the statutory instrument the opportunity to submit a written statement within three weeks, which period begins to run as from the day of publication of the draft of the statutory instrument.</p><p><a name="p0079"><!----></a>(5) If a request as referred to in subsection (1) is submitted, for the first time, in one of the sectors referred to in section 4 (1), then after the expiry of the time limit under subsection (4), the Committee as referred to in section 5 (1) sentence 1 of the Collective Agreements Act (<i>Tarifvertragsgesetz</i>) (Collective Agreements Committee) is involved. If at least four of the members of the Committee vote for the application or the Committee does not submit a statement within a period of two months, a statutory instrument as referred to in subsection (1) may be issued. If two or three members of the Committee vote for the application, a statutory instrument can only be issued by the Federal Government.

Sentence 1 does not apply to collectively agreed working conditions under section 5 sentence 1 no. 1a. The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs issues a statutory instrument applicable to the care sector (section 10) in consultation with the Federal Ministry of Health without the approval of the Bundesrat. In the case of a statutory instrument issued in accordance with sentence 3, the conditions set out in subsection (1a) are also to be met and consideration is also to be given to the legislative objectives under section 11 (2).</p><p><a name="p0082"><!----></a>(1a) Before concluding a collective agreement as referred to in subsection (1) which is applicable to the care sector, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs gives notice, upon joint notification by the parties to the collective agreement, that negotiations on such a collective agreement have begun. Religious communities within whose remit commissions constituted on the basis of parity which determine working conditions under canon law for the remit of church employers in the care sector have been established may, within three weeks following such notice, designate to the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs a commission established for its remit which is to be heard by the parties to the collective agreement in respect of the anticipated content of that collective agreement. The hearing is oral if the relevant commission or the parties to the collective agreement so request. The request as referred to in subsection (1) requires the written consent of at least two of the commissions appointed in accordance with sentence 2. These commissions need to have been established within the remits of religious communities within which a total at least two thirds of all workers employed in the care sector within the remits of religious communities are employed. A commission&#8217;s consent remedies any defects in connection with its hearing.</p><p><a name="p0083"><!----></a>(2) Section 7 (2) and (3) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0084"><!----></a>(3) Before issuing the statutory instrument, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs gives those employers and workers covered by the scope of application of that statutory instrument and those employers and workers possibly affected by it, the parties to the collective agreement, as well as any trade unions, employers&#8217; associations and commissions constituted on the basis of parity which lay down working conditions under canon law for the remit of church employers which are interested in the outcome of the process the opportunity to submit a written statement within three weeks, which period begins to run on the day of publication of the draft of the statutory instrument. The opportunity to submit a statement in particular also encompasses the question of whether the coverage of the provisions of the collective agreement is suited to achieving the legislative objectives under section 1 and, in particular, to countering predatory competition in respect of wage costs. If the statutory instrument is applicable to the care sector, the opportunity to submit a statement in particular also encompasses the issue of the extent to which the provisions of the collective agreement are suited to achieving the legislative objectives under section 11 (2).</p><p><a name="p0085"><!----></a>(4) If a request is made in accordance with subsection (1), then after the expiry of the time limit under subsection (3) the Committee as referred to in section 5 (1) sentence 1 of the Collective Agreements Act (Collective Agreements Committee) is involved. If at least four of the members of the Committee vote for the application or the Committee does not submit a statement within a period of two months, then a statutory instrument may be issued in accordance with subsection (1). If two or three of the members of the Committee vote for the application, a statutory instrument can only be issued by the Federal Government.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0086">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0086"><!----></a>Section 8<br />Employer&#8217;s obligation to guarantee working conditions</p><p><a name="p0087"><!----></a>(1) Employers established in Germany or abroad which are included in the scope of application of a collective agreement as referred to in section 3 sentence 1 no. 1 which has been declared universally applicable or of a statutory instrument as referred to in section 7 or section 7a are obligated to guarantee their workers at least those working conditions which are prescribed under the collective agreement for their place of employment and to pay those contributions to a joint facility of the parties to the collective agreement which are due under section 5 no. 3.
