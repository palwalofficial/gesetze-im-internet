This entitlement may be bequeathed or sold only together with the business.

The proprietor of the patent is entitled to remuneration from the proprietor of the compulsory licence, such remuneration being equitable in the circumstances of the case and taking into account the economic value of the compulsory licence.

In all other cases, section 43 (2) sentences 2 and 3, and (3) and (5) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0315"><!----></a>(4) If, following communication to the applicant (subsection (3) sentence 2), the request filed by the third party is deemed to be ineffective, the German Patent and Trade Mark Office communicates this to both the third party and the applicant. In the event of the request filed by the third party being ineffective, the applicant may himself or herself file a request before the expiry of a period of three months from the service of the communication, provided that this time limit expires later than the time limit referred to in subsection (2). If the applicant does not file the request, a notice is published in the Patent Gazette that this request is ineffective, making reference to the publication of the request filed by the third party.</p><p><a name="p0316"><!----></a>(5) The examination procedure is continued even if the request for examination is withdrawn.

When assessing reasonableness, account is in particular to be taken of the economic situation of the party suffering damage, the amount of the expenses for the invention or for acquiring rights in the invention, the level of probability of the need to keep the invention secret discernible when the expenses arose, as well as the benefit ensuing for the party suffering damage from other use of the invention.

The facts justifying the opposition must be detailed. The particulars, insofar as they have not already been included in the notice of opposition, are to be submitted in writing within the opposition period.</p><p><a name="p0370"><!----></a>(2) Where a notice of opposition to a patent has been given, any third party who can prove that an action has been brought against them on account of an infringement of the patent may intervene in the opposition proceedings as an opponent after the expiry of the opposition period if they give notice of intervention within three months after the date on which the action claiming the infringement was filed. The same applies to any third party who can prove that, following a demand by the proprietor of the patent that the third party refrain from the alleged infringement of the patent, they instituted proceedings for a ruling that they are not infringing the patent. The notice of intervention is to be declared in writing and reasoned within the time limit referred to in sentence 1.

The hearing, including delivery of the decision, is public. Section 169 (1) sentence 2 and sections 171b to 175 of the Courts Constitution Act (<i>Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz</i>) apply accordingly, with the proviso that the public may also be excluded from the hearing at the request of one of the parties if there is concern that the interests of the applicant meriting protection are at risk.</p><p><a name="p0372"><!----></a>(4) The chair of the Patent Division ensures that order is maintained during the hearing and thus exercises domestic authority.</p><p><a name="p0373"><!----></a>(5) In all other cases, section 43 (3) sentence 2 and sections 46 and 47 apply accordingly in the opposition proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0374">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0374"><!----></a>Section 60<br />(repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0375">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0375"><!----></a>Section 61</p><p><a name="p0376"><!----></a>(1) The Patent Division gives its decision by order. In the case of an admissible opposition, the Patent Division gives a decision as to whether and to what extent the patent is to be maintained or revoked. If the opponent withdraws the opposition, the proceedings continue ex officio without the opponent. In derogation from sentence 3, the proceedings are concluded if the opposition which has been withdrawn was exclusively based on the ground for revocation of usurpation pursuant to section 21 (1) no. 3. In such cases, or if the proceedings on the merits have been disposed of, the conclusion of the proceedings is determined by order.</p><p><a name="p0377"><!----></a>(2) In derogation from subsection (1), the Board of Appeal at the Federal Patent Court issues a decision</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0378"><!----></a>1.  if a party so requests and no other party opposes this within two months after service of the request, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0379"><!----></a>2.  at the request of only one party, if at least 15 months have elapsed since the expiry of the opposition period, in the event of the request being made by a person who has intervened in the proceedings since giving notice of intervention.</p><p><a name="p0380"><!----></a>This does not apply if the Patent Division served summons to a hearing or served the decision on the opposition within three months after receipt of the request for a decision by the Federal Patent Court.

The determination may also be made if the opposition is withdrawn in full or in part or if the patent is surrendered. The Patent Division may order that the opposition fee to be paid in accordance with the Patent Costs Act is to be reimbursed in full or in part if this is equitable.</p><p><a name="p0385"><!----></a>(2) The costs include the expenses incurred by the German Patent and Trade Mark Office and the costs arising for the parties, insofar as they were necessary to ensure appropriate safeguarding of the claims and rights. The amount of the costs to be reimbursed is determined upon request by the German Patent and Trade Mark Office. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure concerning the procedure for the assessment of costs (sections 103 to 107) and compulsory enforcement based on orders assessing the costs (sections 724 to 802) apply accordingly. The appeal from the order assessing the costs is available instead of the legal remedy provided for under the Code of Civil Procedure (<i>Erinnerung</i>); section 73 applies, with the proviso that the appeal must be lodged within two weeks.

Such indication is, as a rule, to be made within six months following service of the action. Where patent litigation is pending, the indication is, as a rule, also to be made ex officio to the other court. The Federal Patent Court may, in preparation for the indication to be made in accordance with sentence 1, set the parties a time limit for final written submissions. If the Federal Patent Court does not set a time limit, the indication may not be made before the expiry of the time limit under section 82 (3) sentences 2 and 3. The Federal Patent Court is not bound to take into consideration any submissions made by the parties which are received following expiry of the time limit.
