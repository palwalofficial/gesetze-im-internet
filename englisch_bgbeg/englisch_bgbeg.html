If a traveller has already accepted the organiser&#8217;s offer before the day on which this provision entered into force under Article 3 (1) sentence 1 of the Act of 10 July 2020 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 1643), which offer was made under the conditions of sentence 1, then the traveller may demand that the voucher be modified so that it meets the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) or that it be exchanged for a voucher which meets the requirements of subsections (2) and (3).</p><p><a name="p0282"><!----></a>(2) The value of the travel voucher must correspond to the advance payments made. No costs may be changed for issuing, shipping and redeeming the voucher.</p><p><a name="p0283"><!----></a>(3) In addition to its value, the travel voucher must indicate </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0284"><!----></a>1.  that it was issued on account of the COVID-19 pandemic,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0285"><!----></a>2.  how long it is valid for,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0286"><!----></a>3.  that the traveller may, under the conditions set out in subsection (5), demand that any advance payments made be refunded and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0287"><!----></a>4.  that the traveller is protected, under subsection (6), in the event of the organiser&#8217;s insolvency and that any additional promises of performance made by the organiser are not covered by the insolvency protection.</p><p><a name="p0288"><!----></a>(4) The travel voucher ceases to be valid on 31 December 2021 at the latest.</p><p><a name="p0289"><!----></a>(5) Organisers of packages must immediately, within 14 days at the latest, refund travellers the price of any advance payments made if the traveller has not redeemed the voucher before it ceases to be valid.</p><p><a name="p0290"><!----></a>(6) Should the organiser of the package become illiquid, insolvency proceedings be opened against its assets or a petition to commence insolvency proceedings be rejected for lack of assets, travellers may demand an immediate refund of any advance payments made from the customer deposit insurer referred to in the package contract pursuant to Article 250 section 6 (2) no. 3; the provision of section 651r of the Civil Code applies to that extent. If the customer deposit insurer has limited its liability for the total amounts to be refunded within the course of one business year to 110 million euros and has, therefore, only satisfied the traveller&#8217;s claim on a pro rata basis in accordance with section 651r (3) sentence 4 of the Civil Code, then the traveller may, on the basis of the travel voucher, demand repayment of the remainder of the advance payments from the Federal Republic of Germany. The traveller must provide proof of the amount of the refund which has already been received. If the Treasury satisfies the traveller&#8217;s claims, then claims against the organiser of the package and the customer deposit insurer transfer to the Treasury. In all other cases, the Treasury may make the refund dependent on the traveller assigning, to the Treasury, any claims to a refund against a third party which are not covered by sentence 4.</p><p><a name="p0291"><!----></a>(7) In view of the additional state protection afforded to the voucher under subsection (6) sentence 2, the Federal Republic of Germany may levy a guarantee premium from the organiser of the package.</p><p><a name="p0292"><!----></a>(8) The Federal Government is authorised to regulate, by way of statutory instrument not requiring the approval of the Bundesrat, details concerning the refund procedure and the levying of guarantee premiums.</p><p><a name="p0293"><!----></a>(9) The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection is the competent agency as regards the refund referred to in subsection (6) sentence 2 to sentence 5. The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection may delegate this task to the Federal Office of Justice. The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection or the Federal Office of Justice may avail itself of the services of suitable third parties in the fulfilment of its tasks. In the context of the fulfilment of these tasks, the task of effecting payment is also transferred to the agency competent for the refund procedure in its capacity as agency competent for payments in accordance with section 70 of the Federal Budget Code (<i>Bundeshaushaltsordnung</i>). Should the competent agency avail itself of the services of a third party in the fulfilment of its tasks, it may also, in its capacity as agency competent in accordance with section 70 of the Federal Budget Code, delegate to that third party the effecting of payment. The necessary provisions of the Federal Budget Code and the implementing provisions issued in relation to them are to be applied accordingly to that extent. Further details are determined in agreement with the Federal Ministry of Finance.</p><p><a name="p0294"><!----></a>(10) The organiser of the package may only rely, vis-à-vis the retailer, on the package contract which was sold no longer existing if the organiser is required to pay out the value of the travel voucher.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0295">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0295"><!----></a>Section 7<br />Interference with the basis of the transaction in relation to rental and lease contracts</p><p><a name="p0296"><!----></a>(1) Where, as a consequence of government measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, leased land or leased premises which are not residential premises cannot be used for the tenant&#8217;s operations or only with significant restrictions, the presumption is made that a circumstance within the meaning of section 313 (1) of the Civil Code which became the basis of the rental contract has significantly changed since the contract was entered into.</p><p><a name="p0297"><!----></a>(2) Subsection (1) applies accordingly to lease contracts.</p></div></div><div id="fusszeile"><ul class="footerul"><li><a accesskey="1" class="navBlack" href="#Seitenanfang">zum Seitenanfang</a></li><li><a accesskey="6" class="navBlack" href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/impressum.html" title="Impressum">Impressum</a></li><li><a accesskey="8" class="navBlack" href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/datenschutz.html" title="Datenschutz">Datenschutz</a></li><li><a class="navBlack" href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/barrierefreiheit.html" title="Erklärung zur Barrierefreiheit">Barrierefreiheitserklärung</a></li><li><a class="navBlack" href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/feedbackformular.html" title="Barriere melden">Feedback-Formular</a></li><li><a href="print_englisch_bgbeg.html" target="_blank" title="Im neuen Fenster: Anzeigen">Druckansicht</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
