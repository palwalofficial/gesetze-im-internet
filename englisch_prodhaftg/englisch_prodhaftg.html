In case of damage to an item of property, this only applies if the damage was caused to an item of property other than the defective product and this other item of property is of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption und was used by the injured person mainly for his or her own private use or consumption.</p><p><a name="p0013"><!----></a>(2) The producer's liability obligation is excluded if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0014"><!----></a>1.  the producer did not put the product into circulation,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0015"><!----></a>2.  under the circumstances it can be assumed that the defect which caused the damage did not exist at the time when the producer put the product into circulation,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0016"><!----></a>3.  the product was neither manufactured by the producer for sale or any other form of distribution for economic purpose nor manufactured or distributed by the producer in the course of his or her professional activity,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0017"><!----></a>4.  the defect is due to compliance of the product with mandatory regulations at the time when the producer put the product into circulation or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0018"><!----></a>5.  the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when the producer put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the defect to be discovered.</p><p><a name="p0019"><!----></a>(3) The obligation to pay damages of the producer of a component part is also excluded if the defect is attributable to the design of the product in which the component has been fitted or to the instructions given by the manufacturer of the product. Sentence 1 applies accordingly to the producer of a raw material.</p><p><a name="p0020"><!----></a>(4) The injured person bears the burden of proving the defect, the damage and the causal relationship between defect and damage.

The same applies in the case of an imported product if this product does not indicate the identity of the person referred to in subsection (2), even if the name of the producer is known.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0033">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0033"><!----></a>Section 5<br />Two or more parties liable to pay damages</p><p><a name="p0034"><!----></a>If two or more producers are liable to pay damages for the same damage, they are liable jointly and severally. In the relationship of the parties liable to pay damages, liability in damages as well as the extent of compensation to be paid depend, unless otherwise specified, on the circumstances, in particular to what extent the damage is caused mainly by one or the other party; in all other cases, sections 421 to 425, section 426 (1) sentence 2 and section 426 (2) of the German Civil Code (<i>Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch</i>) apply.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0035">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0035"><!----></a>Section 6<br />Reduced liability</p><p><a name="p0036"><!----></a>(1) Where fault on the part of the injured person contributes to the occurrence of the damage, section 254 of the German Civil Code applies; in case of damage to property, the fault of the person who exercises actual control over the item of property is deemed to be equal to the fault of the injured person.</p><p><a name="p0037"><!----></a>(2) The liability of the producer is not reduced when the damage is caused both by a defect in the product and by the act or omission of a third party.

The party liable to pay damages must furthermore reimburse the funeral costs to the party who is responsible for defraying these expenses.</p><p><a name="p0040"><!----></a>(2) If at the time of the injury, the deceased party maintained a relationship with a third party by virtue of which he or she was or was liable to come under the legal obligation to support this third party and if the third party was deprived of the right to maintenance as a result of the death, the party liable to pay damages must indemnify the third party, guaranteeing maintenance to the extent to which the deceased party would have been liable for the length of lifespan he or she would probably have had. Liability for damages also arises if, at the time of injury, the third party had been conceived but not yet born.</p><p><a name="p0041"><!----></a>(3) The party liable to pay damages must make appropriate financial compensation to the surviving dependent who at the time of the injury was in a particularly close personal relationship with the deceased party for the emotional distress caused to the surviving dependent.
