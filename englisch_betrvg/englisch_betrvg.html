Operational reasons are also present if the works council activities cannot be carried out during the personal working hours because of different working hours of the works council members. Such time off is to be granted within a month; if this cannot be done for operational reasons, the time spent on such activities is to be remunerated on the same basis as extra work.</p><p><a name="p0232"><!----></a>(4) During his or her term of office and for one year thereafter the remuneration of a member of the works council may not be fixed at a lower rate than the remuneration paid to employees in a comparable position who have followed the career that is usual in the establishment. The same applies to general benefits granted by the employer. In order to define who is an employee in a comparable position in accordance with sentence 1, the time when the employee took over the office as a member of the works council must be taken into account unless there is an objective reason for a new definition at a later point in time. Employer and works council may lay down in a works agreement a procedure to define employees in a comparable position. The specification of comparability in such a works agreement may only be checked against gross mistakes; the same applies to the definition of employees in a comparable position insofar as employer and works council have agreed on it by mutual consent and this has been documented in writing.</p><p><a name="p0233"><!----></a>(5) During his or her term of office and for one year thereafter a member of the works council may be employed only on activities that rank on the same level as those of the employees referred to in the preceding paragraph, except where this is precluded by imperative operational requirements.</p><p><a name="p0234"><!----></a>(6) Paragraphs (2) and (3) apply accordingly to the participation of training and educational courses, in so far as the knowledge imparted is necessary for the activities of the works council. Operational reasons as defined in paragraph (3) are also present if the training is provided to the works council member outside his working hours due to special features of the establishment&#8217;s working hours regulations; in this case, the claim for compensation is limited to the working hours of one full-time employee per day of training, taking into account the releases stipulated in paragraph (2) hereof. In scheduling the time for attending training and educational courses the works council has to take account of the operational requirements of the establishment. It has to notify the employer in good time of the participation in training and educational courses and of the time at which they are held. If the employer feels that the operational requirements of the establishment have not sufficiently been taken into account, he may submit the case to the conciliation committee. The award of the conciliation committee takes the place of an agreement between the employer and the works council.</p><p><a name="p0235"><!----></a>(7) Without prejudice to paragraph (6), each member of the works council is entitled during his or regular term of office to a paid release for a total of three weeks to enable him or her to participate in training and educational courses that have been approved for this purpose by the competent central labour authority of the Land concerned after consultation with the central organization of trade unions and employers&#8217; associations. The entitlement conferred by the preceding sentence is increased to four weeks for employees who are serving for the first time as a member of the works council and have not yet previously served as a youth and trainee representative. Paragraph (6) sentence 2 to 6 applies.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0236">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0236"><!----></a>Section 38<br />Releases</p><p><a name="p0237"><!----></a>(1) The minimum number of works council members to be released from their work duties depends on the number of employees normally employed in the establishment, as set out below:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0238"><!----></a>200 to 500 employees: 1 member of the works council,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0239"><!----></a>501 to 900 employees 2 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0240"><!----></a>901 to 1500 employees 3 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0241"><!----></a>1501 to 2000 employees 4 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0242"><!----></a>2001 to 3000 employees 5 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0243"><!----></a>3001 to 4000 employees 6 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0244"><!----></a>4001 to 5000 employees 7 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0245"><!----></a>5001 to 6000 employees 8 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0246"><!----></a>6001 to 7000 employees 9 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0247"><!----></a>7001 to 8000 employees 10 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0248"><!----></a>8001 to 9000 employees 11 members of the works council</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0249"><!----></a>9001 to 10000 employees 12 members of the works council.</p><p><a name="p0250"><!----></a>In establishments with more than 10,000 employees one further member of the works council is to be released for each additional fraction of 2,000 employees.

Other arrangements concerning releases can be made by collective or works agreement.</p><p><a name="p0251"><!----></a>(2) The works council members to be released are elected by secret ballot and in accordance with the principles of proportional representation by the works council from its midst after consultation with the employer. If only one list of candidates is proposed, the ballot is carried out in accordance with the principles of the majority vote; if only one works council member is to be released, he or she is elected by simple majority. The works council has to give the employer the names of the members to be released. If the employer feels that the release is not justifiable under the circumstances, he or she may appeal to the conciliation committee within two weeks of being notified. The award of the conciliation committee takes the place of an agreement between the employer and the works council. If the conciliation committee confirms the concern of the employer, it also has to take into account the protection of minorities within the meaning of sentence 1 when deciding upon another works council member to be released. If the employer does not appeal to the conciliation committee, his approval is deemed to have been given and the releases takes effect on the expiry of the two weeks referred to above.

Within a year of the date on which the release comes to an end, members of the works council are to be allowed, as far as the facilities offered by the establishment permit, to take any career training normally provided for the employees of the establishment that they missed because of their release. In respect of members of the works council who were released from their work duties for three full consecutive terms of office, the period referred to in the preceding sentence is extended to two years.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0254">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0254"><!----></a>Section 39<br />Consultation hours</p><p><a name="p0255"><!----></a>(1) The works council may fix hours for consultation during working hours.

On application by the employer the court may issue an interim order releasing him from his obligation under sentence 1 to maintain the employment relationship in the following cases:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0608"><!----></a>1.  if the action brought by the employee is not reasonably likely to succeed or appears abusive; or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0609"><!----></a>2.  the continuation of the employment relationship imposes an unreasonable financial burden on the employer; or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0610"><!----></a>3.  the objection raised by the works council is manifestly unfounded.</p><p><a name="p0611"><!----></a>(6) The employer and the works council may make an agreement to the effect that any notice of dismissal requires the approval of the works council and that differences of opinion on whether a refusal of consent is justified are to be submitted to the decision of the conciliation committee.</p><p><a name="p0612"><!----></a>(7) The foregoing is without prejudice to the regulations relating to the participation of the works council made under the Protection against Dismissal Act.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0613">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0613"><!----></a>Section 103<br />Exceptional dismissal and transfer in special cases</p><p><a name="p0614"><!----></a>(1) The exceptional dismissal of a member of the works council, the youth and trainee delegation, the ship&#8217;s committee and the fleet works council, the electoral board or of candidates for election requires the consent of the works council.</p><p><a name="p0615"><!----></a>(2) If the works council refuses its consent, the employer may apply to the labour court for a decision in lieu of consent if the exceptional dismissal is justified, all circumstances being taken into account.

The foregoing also applies to an agreement on full or part compensation for any financial prejudice sustained by staff as a result of the proposed alterations (social compensation plan). The social compensation plan has the effect of a works agreement.

If mediation is not applied for or the attempt at mediation is unsuccessful, the employer or the works council may submit the case to the conciliation committee. The chairperson of the conciliation committee may request a member of the Executive Board of the Federal Employment Agency or a staff member of the Federal Employment Agency appointed by the Board to take part in the proceedings.</p><p><a name="p0670"><!----></a>(3) The employer and the works council are to submit proposals to the conciliation committee for the settlement of differences on the reconciliation of interests and the social compensation plan.
