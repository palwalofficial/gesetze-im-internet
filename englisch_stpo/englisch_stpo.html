In a judicial examination in the presence of the accused and in the main hearing, except in cases where there is doubt as to the witness&#8217;s identity, the witness is not asked to state his or her full address but only his or her place of residence or the place where he or she is staying. Witnesses who have made observations in their official capacity may state their place of work instead of their full address.</p><p><a name="p0345"><!----></a>(2) Furthermore, witnesses are, as a rule, to be permitted to state their business address or place of work or another address at which documents can be served instead of stating their full address if there is well-founded reason to fear that legally protected interests of the witness or of another person may be endangered or that witnesses or another person may be improperly influenced by witnesses stating their full address. In a judicial examination in the presence of the accused and in the main hearing, the witness is, as a rule, to be permitted not to state his or her place of residence or the place where he or she is staying if the conditions of sentence 1 are met upon such statement being made.</p><p><a name="p0346"><!----></a>(3) If there is well-founded reason to fear that revealing the identity or the place of residence or whereabouts of a witness would endanger that witness&#8217;s or another person&#8217;s life, limb or liberty, the witness may be permitted not to provide personal identification data or to provide such data only in respect of an earlier identity. However, if so asked at the main hearing, the witness is required to state in what capacity the facts he or she is indicating became known to him or her. If the witness has been permitted, under the conditions of sentence 1, not to provide personal identification data or to provide such data only in respect of an earlier identity, then contrary to section 176 (2) sentence 1 of the Courts Constitution Act the witness may completely or partially cover his or her face.</p><p><a name="p0347"><!----></a>(4) If there are sufficient indications that the conditions of subsection (2) or (3) obtain, then witnesses are to be advised of the rights provided thereunder. In the case under subsection (2), witnesses are, as a rule, to be assisted in specifying an address at which documents can be served. Documentation establishing witnesses&#8217; place of residence or whereabouts, full address or identity are to be kept by the public prosecution office. They are only added to the files when the fear of danger ceases. If the witness was permitted to restrict the information to be given in accordance with subsection (2) sentence 1, the public prosecution office arranges ex officio for the registration authority to enter a prohibition of disclosure pursuant to section 51 (1) of the Federal Act on Registration (<i>Bundesmeldegesetz</i>) if the witness consents thereto.</p><p><a name="p0348"><!----></a>(5) Subsections (2) to (4) also apply after conclusion of the examination of the witness. Insofar as a witness was permitted not to provide data, it must be ensured in the course of the provision of information from or inspection of the files that these data are not made known to other persons, unless a danger within the meaning of subsections (2) and (3) appears to be ruled out.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0349">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0349"><!----></a>Section 68a<br />Limitation of right to ask questions to protect privacy</p><p><a name="p0350"><!----></a>(1) Questions concerning facts which may dishonour the witness or a relative of the witness within the meaning of section 52 (1) or which concern their personal sphere of life are, as a rule, to be asked only if they cannot be dispensed with.</p><p><a name="p0351"><!----></a>(2) Questions concerning circumstances justifying the witness&#8217;s credibility in the case at hand, in particular concerning his or her relationship with the accused or the aggrieved person, are to be asked insofar as this is necessary. Witnesses are, as a rule, to be asked about any previous convictions only if their establishment is necessary in order to decide whether the conditions of section 60 no. 2 have been met or to determine a witness&#8217;s credibility.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0352">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0352"><!----></a>Section 68b<br />Assistance of legal counsel for witnesses</p><p><a name="p0353"><!----></a>(1) Witnesses may avail themselves of the assistance of legal counsel. Assisting legal counsel who appears at the examination of a witness is permitted to be present. He or she may be barred from the examination if certain facts justify the assumption that the assisting legal counsel&#8217;s presence would not only negligibly hinder the orderly taking of evidence. As a rule, this is the case if, on the basis of certain facts, it can be assumed that</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0354"><!----></a>1.  assisting counsel participated in the offence to be investigated or in handling stolen data, aiding after the fact, obstruction of prosecution or punishment, or handling of stolen goods connected therewith,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0355"><!----></a>2.  the testimony of the witness will be influenced by the fact that assisting counsel appears to be committed not only to the interests of the witness or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0356"><!----></a>3.  assisting counsel will use information obtained during the examination for the suppression of evidence within the meaning of section 112 (2) no. 3 or will pass on such information in a manner which is detrimental to the purpose of the investigation.</p><p><a name="p0357"><!----></a>(2) A witness who does not have the assistance of legal counsel at his or her examination and of whose interests meriting protection account cannot be taken in another way is to be assigned such counsel for the duration of the examination if special circumstances obtain from which it is evident that the witness is unable to exercise his or her rights at the examination. Section 142 (5) sentences 1 and 3 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0358"><!----></a>(3) Decisions pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 3 and subsection (2) sentence 1 are not contestable.

In derogation from sentence 1, the taking of blood samples does not require a judicial order if certain facts give rise to the suspicion that one of the offences under section 315a (1) no. 1 and (2) and (3), section 315c (1) no. 1 (a) and (2) and (3) or section 316 of the Criminal Code has been committed.</p><p><a name="p0409"><!----></a>(3) Blood samples or other cell tissue taken from the accused may be used only for the purposes of the criminal proceedings for which they were taken or in other criminal proceedings pending; they must be destroyed without delay as soon as they are no longer required for such purposes.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0410">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0410"><!----></a>Section 81b<br />Photographs and fingerprints of accused</p><p><a name="p0411"><!----></a>(1) Photographs and fingerprints of the accused may be taken, even against his or her will, and measurements may be made of the accused and other similar measures taken with regard to him or her insofar as is required for the purposes of conducting the criminal proceedings or for the purposes of the police records department.</p><p><a name="p0412"><!----></a>(2) Apart from the cases under subsection (1), fingerprints of the accused are to be taken, even against his or her will, for the creation of a data record pursuant to Article 5 (1) (b) of Regulation (EU) 2019/816 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 establishing a centralised system for the identification of Member States holding conviction information on third-country nationals and stateless persons (ECRIS-TCN) to supplement the European Criminal Records Information System and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 (OJ L 135, 22.5.2019, p. 1), as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/818 (OJ L 135, 22.5.2019, p. 85), insofar as</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0413"><!----></a>1.  the accused is a third-country national within the meaning of Article 3 no. 7 of Regulation (EU) 2019/816,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0414"><!----></a>2.  the accused has been sentenced by final decision to a term of imprisonment or to a youth penalty or a final order has been made against him or her for only a measure of reform and prevention involving deprivation of liberty,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0415"><!----></a>3.  no fingerprints of the accused are available which were taken in the context of the criminal proceedings and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0416"><!----></a>4.  the corresponding entry in the Federal Central Criminal Register has not yet been deleted.</p><p><a name="p0417"><!----></a>If, based on certain facts and considering the circumstances of the individual case, there is a risk that the accused will evade this measure, then, in derogation from sentence 1 no. 2, the fingerprints may already be taken before the decision enters into force.</p><p><a name="p0418"><!----></a>(3) For the creation of a data record pursuant to Article 5 (1) (b) of Regulation (EU) 2019/816, fingerprints taken in accordance with subsection (1) for the purpose of conducting the criminal proceedings and fingerprints taken in accordance with subsection (2) or under section 163b (1) sentence 3 are to be transmitted to the Federal Criminal Police Office.</p><p><a name="p0419"><!----></a>(4) For the creation of a data record pursuant to Article 5 (1) (b) of Regulation (EU) 2019/816, the Federal Criminal Police Office may process fingerprints which have been recorded in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) and under section 163b (1) sentence 3 and which have been transmitted to it. The storage of fingerprints taken in accordance with subsection (1) for the purpose of conducting criminal proceedings and fingerprints taken in accordance with subsection (2) sentence 2 and under section 163b (1) sentence 3 which goes beyond their processing in accordance with sentence 1 is inadmissible until the decision has entered into force.

If the statutory representative is precluded from taking a decision (section 52 (2) sentence 2) or is prevented from taking a decision in time for other reasons and the immediate examination or taking of blood samples appears necessary to secure evidence, such measures are admissible only upon special order by the court and, if the court cannot be reached in time, by the public prosecution office.

The experts take technical and organisational steps to ensure that no inadmissible molecular and genetic analyses can be carried out and that no unauthorised third parties have access to information concerning the analyses. The material to be analysed is to be given to the expert with no indication of the name, address or date or month of birth of the individual concerned. If the expert is not a public agency, the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1; L 314, 22.11.2016, p. 72; L 127, 23.5.2018, p. 2) and of the Federal Data Protection Act (<i>Bundesdatenschutzgesetz</i>) apply, even if personal data are not automatically processed and the data are not stored or are not to be stored in a file system.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0441">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0441"><!----></a>Section 81g<br />DNA profiling</p><p><a name="p0442"><!----></a>(1) If the accused person is suspected of having committed an offence of substantial significance or a crime against sexual self-determination, then for the purposes of establishing identity in future criminal proceedings cell tissue may be collected from him or her and subjected to molecular and genetic analysis for the purpose of establishing the accused person&#8217;s DNA profile or sex if the nature of the offence or the way it was committed, the personality of the accused or other information provides grounds for assuming that criminal proceedings will be conducted against him or her in the future in respect of a criminal offence of substantial significance.

Where such asset seizure is to be enforced pursuant to the provisions governing the attachment of movable property, this may be done by the authority designated in section 2 of the Act on the Recovery of Claims of the Judicial Authorities (<i>Justizbeitreibungsgesetz</i>), by the court bailiff, the public prosecution office or its investigators (section 152 of the Courts Constitution Act).

If the apprehended person raises other objections to the warrant of arrest or its enforcement which are not manifestly unfounded or if the court has doubts regarding the continuation of detention, it informs the competent court and the competent public prosecution office without delay, using the fastest means available in the circumstances; the competent court is required without delay to review whether the warrant of arrest is to be revoked or its enforcement suspended.</p><p><a name="p1136"><!----></a>(3) If the accused is not released, he or she is, upon request, to be brought before the competent court for examination in accordance with section 115.

The latter may make submissions in the proceedings.</p><p><a name="p1359"><!----></a>(3) The court before which the proceedings are pending may order suspension of the rights of defence counsel under sections 147 and 148 pending an order on exclusion by the court competent under subsection (1); it may also order suspension of such rights with respect to the cases designated in section 138a (4) and (5). Prior to the preferment of public charges and subsequent to final conclusion of the proceedings, the order under sentence 1 is given by the court which is required to decide on the exclusion of defence counsel. The order takes the form of an incontestable decision. The court is required to appoint, for the duration of the order, another defence counsel to exercise the rights under sections 147 and 148. Section 142 (5) to (7) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p1360"><!----></a>(4) If the court before which the proceedings are pending makes a submission pursuant to subsection (2) during the main hearing, it must simultaneously interrupt or suspend the main hearing until a decision is given by the court competent pursuant to subsection (1). The main hearing may be interrupted for no more than 30 days.</p><p><a name="p1361"><!----></a>(5) If defence counsel, on his or her own initiative or at the request of the accused, withdraws from participating in the proceedings after an application for his or her exclusion has been filed pursuant to subsection (2) or the matter has been submitted to the court competent to decide, this court may continue the exclusion proceedings with the aim of determining whether the participation of defence counsel who has withdrawn is admissible in the proceedings. The determination of inadmissibility is equivalent to exclusion within the meaning of sections 138a, 138b and 138d.</p><p><a name="p1362"><!----></a>(6) If defence counsel has been excluded from participating in the proceedings, costs caused by the suspension can be imposed on him or her. The decision on this is taken by the court before which the proceedings are pending.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1363">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1363"><!----></a>Section 138d<br />Procedure for exclusion of defence counsel</p><p><a name="p1364"><!----></a>(1) A decision on the exclusion of defence counsel is given after an oral hearing.</p><p><a name="p1365"><!----></a>(2) Defence counsel is to be summoned to the oral hearing.

Section 247a (2) sentence 1 and sentence 3 applies accordingly to the hearing of the president of the bar association. The extent to which evidence is taken is determined by the court at its duty-bound discretion. A record must be drawn up of the hearing; sections 271 to 273 apply accordingly.</p><p><a name="p1368"><!----></a>(5) The decision is to be pronounced at the end of the oral hearing.

An offence which is reported orally must be recorded in writing. Upon application, the aggrieved person is to be provided with written confirmation of receipt of the report. Such confirmation as a rule includes a short summary of the aggrieved person&#8217;s statements regarding the time and place of commission of the offence, and of the type of offence reported.

Any information which is obtained nonetheless may not be used. Any recording of such information is to be deleted without delay. The fact that the information was obtained and deleted is to be placed on record.

Insofar as is expedient, the measure should be dispensed with or, to the extent possible for this type of measure, restricted.

The police authorities and police officers are obliged to comply with the request or order of the public prosecution office and are entitled, in such cases, to request information from all the authorities.</p><p><a name="p1585"><!----></a>(2) Insofar as this statute expressly stipulates that personal data must be deleted, section 58 (3) of the Federal Data Protection Act does not apply.</p><p><a name="p1586"><!----></a>(3) If measures under this statute are admissible only if the commission of particular offences is suspected, personal data which have been obtained as a result of a corresponding measure taken pursuant to another statute may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings without the consent of the person affected by the measure only to investigate one of the offences in respect of which such a measure could have been ordered to investigate the offence pursuant to this statute.

If the public prosecution office additionally considers it necessary that a warrant of arrest be issued or an order for placement be made, it may also, without prejudice to sections 125 and 126a, submit such an application before the court designated in sentence 1. The local court in the district of which the investigation procedures are to be carried out are competent to undertake examinations and inspections if the public prosecution office submits its application to such court in order to expedite proceedings or to avoid inconvenience to the persons concerned.</p><p><a name="p1596"><!----></a>(2) The court is required to examine whether, given the circumstances of the case, the investigation applied for is permitted by law.</p><p><a name="p1597"><!----></a>(3) After the preferment of public charges, the court seized of the matter is the competent court.

The presiding judge examines the defendant on his or her personal situation.</p><p><a name="p1901"><!----></a>(3) Thereupon, the public prosecutor reads out the charges. In the cases under section 207 (3), the public prosecutor bases these on the new bill of indictment. In the cases under section 207 (2) no. 3, the public prosecutor reads out the charges and submits the legal assessment on which the decision to open the main hearing was based; he or she may, in addition, express an own divergent legal opinion. In the cases under section 207 (2) no. 4, the public prosecutor takes into account any amendments ordered by the court when admitting the case for a main hearing.</p><p><a name="p1902"><!----></a>(4) The presiding judge states whether discussions pursuant to sections 202a and 212 have taken place, whether their subject matter has been the possibility of a negotiated agreement (section 257c) and, if so, their essential content. This duty also obtains in the further course of the main hearing, insofar as changes have occurred in regard to the information given at the commencement of the main hearing.</p><p><a name="p1903"><!----></a>(5) The defendant is then to be informed that he or she may choose to respond to the charges or not to make any statement on the charges. If the defendant is prepared to respond, he or she is to be examined on the charges in accordance with section 136 (2). Upon application, in particularly extensive first-instance proceedings before a regional court or higher regional court in which the main hearing will presumably last more than 10 days, defence counsel is to be given the opportunity to make a statement on the defendant&#8217;s behalf before the defendant&#8217;s examination; this statement may not anticipate the closing speech. The presiding judge may require that defence counsel submit any further statement in writing if otherwise the course of proceedings would be significantly delayed; section 249 (2) sentence 1 applies accordingly. The defendant&#8217;s previous convictions are to be disclosed only insofar as they are relevant to the decision. It is for the presiding judge to determine when such convictions are to be disclosed.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1904">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1904"><!----></a>Section 244<br />Taking of evidence; inquisitorial system; rejection of applications to take evidence</p><p><a name="p1905"><!----></a>(1) The examination of the defendant is followed by the taking of evidence.</p><p><a name="p1906"><!----></a>(2) To establish the truth, the court ex officio extends the taking of evidence to all facts and means of proof which are relevant to the decision.</p><p><a name="p1907"><!----></a>(3) An &#699;application to take evidence&#700; within the meaning of this statute means that the applicant has earnestly requested that evidence about a precisely alleged concrete fact concerning the question of guilt or relating to legal consequences be taken by means of a precisely designated piece of evidence and the application indicates why that designated piece of evidence is purported to be able to prove the alleged fact. An application to take evidence is to be rejected if the taking of such evidence is inadmissible. In all other cases, an application to take evidence may be rejected only</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1908"><!----></a>1.  if the taking of such evidence is superfluous because the matter is common knowledge,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1909"><!----></a>2.  if the fact to be proved is irrelevant to the decision,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1910"><!----></a>3.  if the fact to be proved has already been proved,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1911"><!----></a>4.  if the evidence is wholly inappropriate,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1912"><!----></a>5.  if the evidence is unobtainable or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1913"><!----></a>6.  if an important allegation which is intended to offer proof in exoneration of the defendant may be treated as if the alleged fact were true.</p><p><a name="p1914"><!----></a>(4) Unless otherwise provided, an application to take evidence by examining an expert may also be rejected if the court itself possesses the necessary specialist knowledge. The hearing of another expert may even be refused if the opposite of the alleged fact has already been proved by the first expert opinion; this rule does not apply to cases where the professional competence of the first expert is in doubt, if his or her opinion is based on incorrect factual suppositions, if the opinion contains contradictions or if the new expert has means of research at his or her disposal which appear to be superior to the ones of an earlier expert.</p><p><a name="p1915"><!----></a>(5) An application to take evidence by inspection may be rejected if the court, according to its duty-bound discretion, does not deem the inspection to be necessary to establish the truth. Applications to take evidence by examining a witness may be rejected under the same condition if the witness has to be summoned from abroad. An application for the taking of evidence by reading out a source document may be rejected if, according to the court&#8217;s duty-bound discretion, there is no reason to doubt that it corresponds in terms of content to the transmitted document.</p><p><a name="p1916"><!----></a>(6) An application to take evidence is rejected by court order. Rejection as per sentence 1 is not required if the taking of evidence can provide nothing which is of expedience in the applicant&#8217;s favour, the applicant is aware of that fact and he or she intends to use the application to protract proceedings; the intent to protract proceedings poses no obstacle to the pursuit of other goals which are extraneous to the proceedings. After concluding the ex officio taking of evidence, the presiding judge may determine an appropriate period for the submission of applications to take evidence. A decision on applications to take evidence submitted after the end of the period determined may be given in the judgment; this does not apply if it was not possible to submit an application to take evidence before the expiry of the period determined. If an application to take evidence is submitted after the end of the period determined, the facts which made it impossible to meet the deadline must be substantiated in the application.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1917">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1917"><!----></a>Section 245<br />Extent of taking of evidence; evidence produced</p><p><a name="p1918"><!----></a>(1) The taking of evidence is to be extended to all witnesses and experts who were summoned by the court and who appeared and to the other evidence produced by the court or the public prosecution office pursuant to section 214 (4), unless the taking of evidence is inadmissible.

The defendant&#8217;s removal may be ordered for the duration of discussions concerning the defendant&#8217;s condition and treatment prospects if serious detriment to the defendant&#8217;s health is to be feared.

The decision is not contestable. Simultaneous audio-visual transmission of the testimony is to be provided in the courtroom.

If criminal law makes mitigation dependent on the existence of a less serious case, the reasons for the judgment must indicate why these circumstances are deemed to exist or are denied contrary to an application filed at the hearing; this applies accordingly to the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment in the cases under section 47 of the Criminal Code. The judgment must also indicate in its reasons why an especially serious case is deemed not to exist if the conditions generally applying to such a case under criminal law are met; if these conditions are not met but an especially serious case is nonetheless deemed to exist, sentence 2 applies accordingly. The reasons for the judgment must further indicate the grounds for suspending the sentence on probation or for not doing so contrary to an application filed at the hearing; this applies accordingly to a warning with sentence reserved and to dispensing with imposing a penalty.

Subsection (3) sentence 5 applies accordingly. The further content of the reasons for the judgment is determined by the court, taking into consideration, at its discretion, the circumstances of the individual case. The reasons for the judgment may be supplemented within the time limit provided for in section 275 (1) sentence 2 if restoration of the status quo ante is granted in respect of the failure to observe the time limit for seeking an appellate remedy.</p><p><a name="p2036"><!----></a>(5) If the defendant is acquitted, the reasons for the judgment must indicate whether the defendant&#8217;s guilt was deemed not proved or whether and on what basis the act deemed proved was considered not to give rise to criminal liability. If all parties entitled to an appellate remedy waive their right of appellate remedy or if no appellate remedy is sought within the given time limit, it is only necessary to state whether it was for factual or legal reasons that the offence with which the defendant was charged was not established.

If the court issues the defendant with directions pursuant to section 68b (1) of the Criminal Code, the presiding judge also informs him or her that a penalty pursuant to section 145a of the Criminal Code is also possible. The direction is, as a rule, to be issued following pronouncement of the order pursuant to subsection (1) or (2). If placement in a psychiatric hospital is suspended on probation, the presiding judge may dispense with the notification regarding the possibility of a revocation of suspension.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2046">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2046"><!----></a>Section 268b<br />Order for continuation of remand detention</p><p><a name="p2047"><!----></a>When passing judgment, the court decides ex officio on the continuation of remand detention or provisional placement.

Once the time limit has expired, the reasons for the judgment may no longer be amended. The time limit may be exceeded only if and as long as the court has been prevented from observing it owing to a circumstance which cannot be anticipated or averted in the particular case. The date on which the judgment is added to the files and the date of any amendment of the reasons must be placed on record.</p><p><a name="p2079"><!----></a>(2) The judgment is to be signed by the judges who participated in the decision.

The public prosecution office hands over the files to the presiding judge of the court in time for a decision to be given within the time limit set out in subsection (5). Where placement in a psychiatric hospital has been declared disposed of pursuant to section 67d (6) sentence 1 of the Criminal Code, the enforcing authority sends the files without delay to the public prosecution office at the court competent to make a subsequent order of preventive detention (section 66b of the Criminal Code). If the public prosecution office intends to apply for a subsequent order of preventive detention, it notifies the person concerned thereof. The public prosecution office must, as a rule, without delay submit its application for a subsequent order of preventive detention and hand it over to the presiding judge together with the files.</p><p><a name="p2085"><!----></a>(2) Unless otherwise provided in the following, sections 213 to 275 apply accordingly to the preparation and conduct of the main hearing.</p><p><a name="p2086"><!----></a>(3) After commencement of the main hearing in accordance with section 243 (1), a rapporteur reports, in the absence of the witnesses, on the results of the proceedings up to that point. The presiding judge reads out the previous judgment, insofar as it is of relevance for the decision on the reserved or subsequent order for preventive detention. Thereafter, the convicted person is examined and the evidence taken.</p><p><a name="p2087"><!----></a>(4) Prior to arriving at a decision, the court obtains an expert&#8217;s opinion. If a decision is to be taken as to whether a subsequent order for preventive detention is to be made, two experts&#8217; opinions must be obtained. The experts may not be persons who have been involved in the treatment of the convicted person in the context of imprisonment or placement.</p><p><a name="p2088"><!----></a>(5) The court is, as a rule, to give a decision on the reserved order of preventive detention no later than six months before the sentence of imprisonment has been fully served.</p><p><a name="p2089"><!----></a>(6) If there are cogent reasons to believe that preventive detention will be subsequently ordered, the court may make an order for placement until such time as the judgment becomes final. The court competent to decide pursuant to section 67d (6) of the Criminal Code remains responsible for the making of the order for placement up until the application for an order for subsequent preventive detention is received by the court responsible for this decision. In the cases under section 66a of the Criminal Code, the court may make an order for placement up until the judgment becomes final if it ordered preventive detention reserved at first instance prior to the time specified in section 66a (3) sentence 1 of the Criminal Code. Sections 114 to 115a, 117 to 119a and section 126a (3) apply accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2090">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2090"><!----></a>Division 8<br />Proceedings against absent persons</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2091">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2091"><!----></a>Section 276<br />Meaning of &#8216;absent&#8217;</p><p><a name="p2092"><!----></a>Accused persons are deemed to be absent if their whereabouts are unknown or if they are abroad and it does not appear feasible or reasonable that they can be brought before the competent court.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2093">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2093"><!----></a>Sections 277 to 284<br />(repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2094">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2094"><!----></a>Section 285<br />Purpose of securing of evidence</p><p><a name="p2095"><!----></a>(1) No main hearing is held in respect of a person who is absent.

Section 121 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure applies, with the proviso that if the indicted accused has defence counsel, the latter is, as a rule, to be assigned to him or her; if the applicant avails himself or herself of the assistance of a lawyer in the main proceedings, the latter is to be assigned to the applicant.

The decision may be limited to the ground for or a part of the asserted claim; section 318 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies accordingly. The court dispenses with a decision if the application is inadmissible or insofar as it appears unfounded. In all other cases, the court may dispense with a decision only if the application is not suited to being dealt with in criminal proceedings even after taking into account the legitimate interests of the applicant. An application will in particular be unsuited to being dealt with in criminal proceedings if its further examination, even where a decision is only considered possible on the ground for or a part of the asserted claim, would considerably protract the proceedings. If the applicant has asserted a claim in respect of damages for bodily harm (section 253 (2) of the Civil Code), a decision may only be dispensed with in accordance with sentence 3.</p><p><a name="p2596"><!----></a>(2) If the accused acknowledges, in full or in part, the claim asserted against him or her by the applicant, the accused is to be sentenced in pursuance of the acknowledgement.</p><p><a name="p2597"><!----></a>(3) The decision on the application is equivalent to a judgment in civil litigation. The court declares the decision to be provisionally enforceable; sections 708 to 712 and sections 714 and 716 of the Code of Civil Procedure apply accordingly. Insofar as the claim has not been awarded, it may be asserted elsewhere. If a final judgment has been given on the ground for the claim, the hearing concerning the amount takes place before the competent civil court pursuant to section 304 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p><a name="p2598"><!----></a>(4) The applicant is to be provided with a copy of the judgment with reasons, or an excerpt thereof.</p><p><a name="p2599"><!----></a>(5) If the court is considering dispensing with a decision on the application, it informs the parties to the proceedings thereof as soon as possible. As soon as the court considers, after hearing the applicant, that the conditions for a decision on the application are not met, it makes an order dispensing with a decision on the claim.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2600">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2600"><!----></a>Section 406a<br />Appellate remedies</p><p><a name="p2601"><!----></a>(1) An immediate complaint against the order dispensing with a decision on the application pursuant to section 406 (5) sentence 2 is admissible if the application was made prior to commencement of the main hearing and as long as proceedings have not been concluded by a final decision at that instance. In all other cases, the applicant is not entitled to an appellate remedy.</p><p><a name="p2602"><!----></a>(2) If the court grants the application, the defendant may contest the decision by an appellate remedy which would otherwise be admissible even without contesting that part of the judgment which concerns the offence. In this case, the decision on the appellate remedy may be given in an order at a sitting held in camera. If the admissible appellate remedy is an appeal on fact and law, then, upon an application by the defendant or the applicant, an oral hearing of the parties is held.</p><p><a name="p2603"><!----></a>(3) If the conviction is quashed and the defendant is found not guilty of an offence and no measure of reform and prevention is ordered against him or her in respect of the decision on which the application was founded, the decision granting the application is to be quashed.

Objections which concern the claim established in the judgment are admissible only to the extent that the reasons on which they are based arose after conclusion of the main hearing at first instance and, if the court hearing the appeal on fact and law has given its decision, after conclusion of the main hearing on the appeal on fact and law.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p2606">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p2606"><!----></a>Section 406c<br />Reopening of proceedings</p><p><a name="p2607"><!----></a>(1) The defendant may limit the application for the reopening of proceedings for the purpose of obtaining an essentially different decision on the claim.

Such criminal chamber also remains competent for decisions which need to be given after enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment has been interrupted or enforcement of the remainder of a sentence of imprisonment has been suspended on probation.

If judgments were pronounced by different courts, the decision is given by the court which imposed the severest type of penalty or, in the case of penalties of the same type, the highest sentence and, if more than one court was then competent, the decision is given by the last court to pronounce judgment. If the relevant judgment was pronounced by a court of higher instance, the court of first instance determines the aggregate sentence; if one of the judgments was pronounced by a higher regional court of first instance, the higher regional court fixes the aggregate sentence.

In the cases under section 68e of the Criminal Code, no oral hearing of the convicted person is necessary. Insofar as the court is called upon to decide on enforcement of preventive detention, section 454 (2) applies accordingly in the cases under section 67d (2) and (3) and section 72 (3) of the Criminal Code, irrespective of the offences designated therein and, in the case of a review of the conditions of section 67c (1) sentence 1 no. 1 of the Criminal Code, also irrespective of whether the court is considering a suspension; in all other respects, section 454 (2) applies to the offences mentioned therein. In preparing the decision pursuant to section 67d (3) of the Criminal Code and the subsequent decisions pursuant to section 67d (2) of the Criminal Code, the court is to obtain an opinion from an expert which focuses in particular on the question of whether it is to be expected that the convicted person will continue to commit serious unlawful acts. If placement in preventive detention has been ordered and the convicted person has no defence counsel, the court appoints such counsel in good time prior to a decision pursuant to section 67c (1) of the Criminal Code.</p><p><a name="p3038"><!----></a>(4) As part of its review of placement in a psychiatric hospital (section 63 of the Criminal Code) pursuant to section 67e of the Criminal Code, the court is to obtain an expert opinion from the facility providing measures of reform and prevention into which the convicted person has been placed. The court must, as a rule, obtain an expert opinion every three years, after six years every two years of placement in a psychiatric hospital. The expert may neither have been concerned with the treatment of the person subject to an order for placement within the context of enforcement of the placement nor may that expert be working in the psychiatric hospital in which the person has been placed, nor may he or she, as a rule, be the person who drew up the last expert opinion rendered during a previous review. The expert who is called in to render the first expert opinion in the course of a review of placement may, as a rule, also not be the person who rendered the expert opinion in the proceedings in which the placement or its subsequent enforcement was ordered. Only experts who are physicians or psychologists and have expert knowledge of and experience in forensic psychology are, as a rule, to be commissioned with rendering an expert opinion. The expert is to be granted inspection of the patient data kept on the detainee by the hospital. Section 454 (2) applies accordingly. If the person detained has no defence counsel, the court appoints such counsel for the review of placement in the course of which an expert opinion is to be obtained pursuant to sentence 2.</p><p><a name="p3039"><!----></a>(5) Section 455 (1) does not apply if placement in a psychiatric hospital has been ordered. If placement in an addiction treatment facility or preventive detention has been ordered and if the convicted person becomes insane, enforcement of the measure may be postponed. Section 456 does not apply if an order has been made placing the convicted person in preventive detention.</p><p><a name="p3040"><!----></a>(6) Section 462 also applies to decisions to be given pursuant to section 67 (3), (5) sentence 2 and (6), section 67a and section 67c (2), section 67d (5) and (6), sections 67g and 67h, section 69a (7) and sections 70a and 70b of the Criminal Code. In the cases under section 67d (6) of the Criminal Code, the convicted person is to be heard in an oral hearing. The court declares the immediate enforceability of the order of measures under section 67h (1) sentences 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code if there is a danger that the convicted person will commit serious unlawful acts; immediate enforcement (section 307 and section 462 (3) sentence 2) still applies in the case of decisions under section 67d (5) sentence 1 of the Criminal Code.</p><p><a name="p3041"><!----></a>(7) Supervision of conduct in the cases under section 67c (1), section 67d (2) to (6) and section 68f of the Criminal Code is equivalent to the suspension of the remainder of a sentence for the purposes of the application of section 462a (1).</p><p><a name="p3042"><!----></a>(8) If placement in preventive detention is enforced and the convicted person has no defence counsel, the court appoints such counsel for the proceedings concerning the court decisions to be given in regard to enforcement. Such appointment is to be made in good time prior to the first court decision and also applies to all further proceedings as long as the appointment is not revoked.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p3043">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p3043"><!----></a>Section 463a<br />Jurisdiction and powers of supervisory authorities</p><p><a name="p3044"><!----></a>(1) The supervisory authorities (section 68a of the Criminal Code) may request information from all public authorities responsible for the supervision of the convicted person&#8217;s conduct and for his or her compliance with directions, and they may carry out investigations of any kind, excluding examinations under oath, or have them carried out by other agencies within the framework of their competence.

The supervisory authority may have the data collected and processed by the police authorities and police officers; these are obliged to comply with the request of the supervisory authority. The data referred to in sentence 1 must be deleted no later than two months after their collection, insofar as they are not used for the purposes referred to in sentence 2. Each time the data are retrieved, at least the time, the data retrieved and the retrieving person are to be recorded; section 488 (3) sentence 5 applies accordingly. If data concerning the convicted person&#8217;s whereabouts beyond the fact of his or her presence are collected on private premises, these data may not be used and must be deleted without delay after cognisance has been taken. The fact of the taking of their cognisance and deletion is to be documented.</p><p><a name="p3054"><!----></a>(5) The supervisory authority in whose district the convicted person has his or her domicile has local jurisdiction.

Section 479 (1) and (2) and section 485 sentence 3 apply accordingly. Probation officers and authorities competent for the supervision of conduct may transmit personal data concerning convicted persons who have been placed under supervision of conduct to prisons and facilities responsible for measures of reform and prevention if these data are necessary in order to enforce the sentence of imprisonment, in particular in order to support the drawing up of prison and treatment plans or to prepare a detained person&#8217;s release; the same applies to notifications made to enforcing authorities insofar as these data are necessary for the purposes referred to in section 477 (2) no. 1 or no. 3.</p><p><a name="p3241"><!----></a>(2) In addition, information may, without prejudice to section 57 of the Federal Data Protection Act, be provided insofar as inspection of the files or information could be granted in accordance with the provisions of this statute.

Furthermore, instead of deleting personal data, their processing may be restricted insofar as they are needed for ongoing research purposes. The processing of personal data is also to be restricted insofar as the data are only stored for the purpose of data backup or data protection monitoring purposes.
