The registration procedure may also be handled by a single entity under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (<i>Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz</i>). In addition to the application, which must encompass all the information to be included in the Legal Services Register in accordance with section 16 (2) sentence 1 no. 1 letters a) to d) and sentence 2, the following is to be produced to enable verification of the requirements set out in section 12 (1) no. 1 and no. 2 and (4):</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0094"><!----></a>1.  a summary of the applicant&#8217;s course of professional training and previous professional practice,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0095"><!----></a>2.  a certificate of good conduct as referred to in section 30 (5) of the Federal Central Criminal Register Act (<i>Bundeszentralregistergesetz</i>),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0096"><!----></a>3.  information as required by section 150 (5) of the Trade Regulation Code (<i>Gewerbeordnung</i>) in the case of an application for registration in the field of collection services,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0097"><!----></a>4.  a declaration as to whether insolvency proceedings are pending or whether an entry has been made in the list of debtors within the last three years before submitting the application (section 882b of the Code of Civil Procedure),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0098"><!----></a>5.  documents providing proof of theoretical and practical expertise.</p><p><a name="p0099"><!----></a>In the cases referred to in section 12 (4), the documents referred to in sentence 4 and documents providing proof of fulfilment of the requirements referred to in section 12 (4) sentence 2 must be produced separately for each qualified person.</p><p><a name="p0100"><!----></a>(2) To permit an examination of the requirements under section 10 (1) sentence 1 no. 1, section 12 (1) no. 2 and section 5 (1), applications for the registration of a collection service must include a description of the content of the planned activities.

Section 15 of the Federal Code for Lawyers applies accordingly to decisions regarding the ground for denial referred to in section 12 (1) no. 1 letter a). Where the registration requirements in section 12 (1) no. 1 and no. 2 and subsection (4) are met, the competent authority requires the applicant to provide proof of the professional indemnity insurance and of the fulfilment of any conditions (section 10 (3) sentence 1) before the expiry of the period referred to in sentence 1. As soon as this proof has been furnished it registers the applicant and arranges for public announcement in the Legal Services Register.
