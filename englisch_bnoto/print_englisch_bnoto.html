The <i>Land</i> department of justice is to determine an appropriate period within which the medical report is to be presented and the doctor who is to issue the report. The report must be drawn up following a medical examination and, if this is deemed necessary by a public health officer, additionally following clinical observation of the person concerned. The costs of the medical report are to be borne by the person concerned. If the medical report is not submitted within the period set without sufficient ground, it is presumed that the ground for refusal as per subsection (2) no. 2 exists. The person concerned is to be informed of these consequences when the time limit is set.</p><p><a name="p0036"><!----></a>(4) Whoever has reached the age of 60 years on the expiry of the deadline for applications for a notarial position cannot be appointed as notary for the first time.</p><p><a name="p0037"><!----></a>(5) Professional aptitude presupposes that qualification to hold judicial office pursuant to the German Judiciary Act (<i>Deutsches Richtergesetz</i>) has been acquired.

The <i>Land</i> department of justice may determine that the three-year service as trainee notary only need be completed by the time the appointment is made.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0040">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0040"><!----></a>Section 5b<br />Further requirements of lawyers commissioned as notary</p><p><a name="p0041"><!----></a>(1) Only those persons are, as a rule, to be appointed as lawyers commissioned as notary who, upon expiry of the deadline for applications, have</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0042"><!----></a>1.  worked as a lawyer on a not insignificant scale for various clients for at least five years,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0043"><!----></a>2.  pursued the activity referred to in no. 1 for at least three years without interruption in the intended notarial jurisdiction,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0044"><!----></a>3.  passed the professional examination for notaries under section 7a and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0045"><!----></a>4.  each year taken part in at least 15 hours of notary-specific continuing training events run by the chambers of notaries or professional organisations as from that calendar year following the year in which they passed the professional examination for notaries.</p><p><a name="p0046"><!----></a>(2) Interruptions on account of the events of daily life are not taken into consideration in the case of an activity as referred to in subsection (1) no. 1 and no. 2. Upon request, interruptions or limitations of activity by reason of pregnancy or looking after children or relatives needing nursing care (section 7 (3) of the Act on Caregiving Leave (<i>Pflegezeitgesetz</i>)) are to be credited against the activity referred to in subsection (1) no. 1 up to a maximum of one year in total. In the case of an activity as referred to in subsection (1) no. 2, the periods referred to in sentence 2 are not considered as an interruption if they last less than one year.</p><p><a name="p0047"><!----></a>(3) It is, in particular, possible to derogate from the requirement under subsection (1) no. 2 if no application meets this requirement but an applicant has been performing the activity referred to in subsection (1) no. 1 without interruption either for at least two years in the intended notarial jurisdiction or for at least three years in the district of a local court which borders the district of the local court within the same <i>Land</i> in which the advertised notarial position is located. Subsection (2) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0048"><!----></a>(4) Further, appointment as a lawyer commissioned as notary presupposes sufficient familiarity with professional notarial practice. This requirement is generally fulfilled after passing the professional examination for notaries and undergoing 160 hours of subsequent practical training with a notary chosen by the chamber of notaries competent for the intended notarial jurisdiction. The practical training may be reduced by up to 80 hours where comparable experience has been gained by working as a deputy notary (<i>Notarvertretung</i>) or as an administrator for a notary (<i>Notariatsverwalter</i>) or on the basis of successfully participating in practical courses run by the chambers of notaries or professional organisations. Details of sentences 1 to 3 are regulated by the chamber of notaries in training regulations which require approval by the <i>Land</i> department of justice.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0049">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0049"><!----></a>Section 6<br />Selection amongst several suitable persons; authorisation to issue statutory instruments</p><p><a name="p0050"><!----></a>(1) If several suitable applicants apply for an office, the sequence in which they are selected is based on their personal and professional aptitude, taking into account the state examination completed following the end of legal training and their performance when preparing for the profession of notary. Consideration is only to be given to those facts and circumstances which existed upon the expiry of the deadline for applications. The <i>Land</i> department of justice may determine a point in time which derogates from that specified in sentence 2 when appointing full-time notaries.</p><p><a name="p0051"><!----></a>(2) When appointing full-time notaries, appropriate consideration is to be given to the length of their service as trainee notary. The <i>Land</i> governments are authorised, by way of statutory instrument, to make determinations regarding the method for calculating the length of the service as trainee notary referred to in sentence 1. This encompasses the power to determine appropriate periods which may be credited against the period of service as trainee notary. The <i>Land</i> governments may delegate this authorisation to the <i>Land</i> departments of justice by way of statutory instrument.</p><p><a name="p0052"><!----></a>(3) When appointing lawyers commissioned as notary, professional aptitude is assessed on the basis of a points system. The result of the professional examination for notaries accounts for 60 per cent, and the result of the state examination taken following the end of legal training accounts for 40 per cent of the point score, unless, in an individual case and after having heard the chamber of notaries, consideration is, by way of exception, to be given to special circumstances in the case of anyone who is or was a notary and these take precedence over the applicant&#8217;s professional aptitude. Where examinees achieve the same point score, account is, ordinarily, to be taken of the result of the professional examination for notaries.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0053">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0053"><!----></a>Section 6a<br />Refusal and stay of appointment</p><p><a name="p0054"><!----></a>(1) Appointment as a notary is to be refused where neither proof of having taken out professional indemnity insurance (section 19a) is furnished, nor a provisional cover note is supplied.</p><p><a name="p0055"><!----></a>(2) The appointment may be stayed if proceedings on suspicion of a criminal offence are pending against the person whose appointment is planned in which the alleged crime raises the expectation that a conviction will be made which would result in refusal of the appointment.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0056">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0056"><!----></a>Section 7<br />Service as trainee notary; authorisation to issue statutory instruments</p><p><a name="p0057"><!----></a>(1) Positions intended for those undertaking their service as trainee notary are to be advertised; section 4a (2) and (3) applies accordingly. In derogation therefrom, the <i>Land</i> department of justice may keep an ongoing list in which the names of those persons wishing to apply for inclusion to serve as trainee notary may be entered for a specified period of time. The fact that such lists are kept is to be generally made known.</p><p><a name="p0058"><!----></a>(2) If several suitable persons apply to serve as trainee notary, they are selected on the basis of personal and professional aptitude, taking particular account of the state examination completed following the end of legal training. Section 6 (1) sentence 2 and 3 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0059"><!----></a>(3) Trainee notaries are appointed by the <i>Land</i> department of justice after it has heard the chamber of notaries. It is for the president of the chamber of notaries to assign trainee notaries to a notary. The president obliges the trainee notary by means of a handshake to conscientiously fulfil his or her duties.</p><p><a name="p0060"><!----></a>(4) Trainee notaries are in a public-law employment relationship with the state whilst serving as trainee notaries. Excepting section 19a, they have the same official duties as a notary. As from the time of their assignment and for the duration of their service as trainee notaries they receive remuneration from the chamber of notaries which is to be comparable to that of a judge on probation. The chamber of notaries enacts guidelines in this regard and determines either generally or in the individual case whether and in what amount the notary to whom a trainee notary has been assigned is obliged to reimburse the remuneration.</p><p><a name="p0061"><!----></a>(5) Trainee notaries are to be employed by the notary in a manner which corresponds to the purpose of the service as trainee notary. The <i>Land</i> government or the agency determined by it by way of a statutory instrument regulates, by way of a statutory instrument, further details concerning the training of trainee notaries.</p><p><a name="p0062"><!----></a>(6) The service as trainee notary ends</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0063"><!----></a>1.  upon the trainee notary being appointed as notary,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0064"><!----></a>2.  upon the trainee notary being discharged from service.</p><p><a name="p0065"><!----></a>(7) Trainee notaries are to be discharged from service upon their request therefor; section 48 sentence 2 and 3 applies accordingly. They may be discharged if they</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0066"><!----></a>1.  prove unsuitable for appointment as notary,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0067"><!----></a>2.  do not commence the service as trainee notary without sufficient reason within a period to be determined by the <i>Land</i> department of justice, which should not exceed two months,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0068"><!----></a>3.  do not apply for a notarial position offered to them by the <i>Land</i> department of justice without sufficient reason after serving three years as trainee notary and that post was previously advertised and could not be filled on account of a lack of suitable applications.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0069">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0069"><!----></a>Section 7a<br />Professional examination for notaries; authorisation to issue statutory instruments</p><p><a name="p0070"><!----></a>(1) Whoever has been admitted to the legal profession for three years and is qualified to hold judicial office pursuant to the German Judiciary Act is admitted to the professional examination for notaries upon application.</p><p><a name="p0071"><!----></a>(2) The professional examination for notaries serves to provide proof that and to what degree a lawyer is professionally suited to exercise the notarial function in the capacity as lawyer commissioned as notary. The examination comprises a written and an oral part.</p><p><a name="p0072"><!----></a>(3) The professional examination for notaries serves to identify the best amongst the examinees. The uniformity of examination requirements and performance assessment is to be guaranteed. The examination may be held at various locations.</p><p><a name="p0073"><!----></a>(4) The topics of the written and of the oral examination cover the entire spectrum of official functions of a notary. The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection regulates the areas covered in the examination by way of a statutory instrument requiring the approval of the Bundesrat.</p><p><a name="p0074"><!----></a>(5) Sections 1 and 2 of the Ordinance on a Mark and Point Scale for the First and Second State Examination in Law (<i>Verordnung über eine Noten- und Punkteskala für die erste und zweite juristische Staatsprüfung</i>) of 3 December 1981 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 1243) apply accordingly to the marks to be awarded by the individual examiners and the composition of the final mark.</p><p><a name="p0075"><!----></a>(6) The written examination accounts for 75 per cent, the oral examination for 25 per cent of the overall result of the professional examination for notaries. Whoever achieves an overall mark of at least 4.00 points is deemed to have passed the professional examination for notaries.</p><p><a name="p0076"><!----></a>(7) Whoever does not pass the examination or has been deemed not to have passed the examination may repeat it once. An examinee who has passed the examination may repeat the examination once with the aim of achieving a better score.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0077">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0077"><!----></a>Section 7b<br />Written examination</p><p><a name="p0078"><!----></a>(1) The written examination comprises four five-hour invigilated examinations. It serves to determine whether the examinee has acquired the specialist knowledge needed to be able to work as a notary and whether he or she is able to provide, within a limited space of time and using the prescribed aids, legally sound and practical solutions to tasks drawn from notarial practice. The written examination may be conducted electronically.</p><p><a name="p0079"><!----></a>(2) Each invigilated examination is marked successively by two examiners. The names of the examinees may not be made known to the examiners before marking of the invigilated examinations has been completed. At least one lawyer commissioned as notary is, as a rule, to be involved in marking each individual task set. If the marks awarded deviate by no more than three points, the average is to be taken. If the marks differ by a larger number of points and the examiners cannot reach agreement or approximate the marks so that they deviate only by up to three points, a third examiner decides; that examiner may decide to take one of the two marks or to award a mark which lies between the two other marks.</p><p><a name="p0080"><!----></a>(3) The marks awarded for the invigilated examinations are made known to examinees when they are invited to the oral examination. Where more than one invigilated examination is awarded less than 4.00 points or the overall average of all the invigilated examinations is less than 3.50 points, the examinee is not permitted to take the oral examination and has not passed the professional examination for notaries.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0081">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0081"><!----></a>Section 7c<br />Oral examination</p><p><a name="p0082"><!----></a>(1) The oral examination comprises a presentation on a problem specific to the office of notary and a group interview which is, as a rule, to cover different subject areas. The group interview is, as a rule, to last around 45 minutes per examinee. No more than five examinees are, as a rule, to be examined at once. Besides evidence of their knowledge, examinees are in particular also to provide evidence in the oral examination that they are able to fulfil a notary&#8217;s duty of examination and instruction in a manner appropriate to the subject matter and the situation.</p><p><a name="p0083"><!----></a>(2) The oral examination is conducted by a board of examiners comprising three members. At least one member must be proposed by a <i>Land</i> department of justice and at least one member must be a lawyer commissioned as notary. The Examination Office assigns one member of the board of examiners to act as chair. The members of the board of examiners must be in attendance throughout the entire examination.</p><p><a name="p0084"><!----></a>(3) Representatives of the chambers of notaries, of the Federal Chamber of Notaries, of the Examination Office, of the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection and of the <i>Land</i> departments of justice may be present during oral examinations. The Examination Office may admit persons who have been admitted to the professional examination for notaries to observe an examination. Only the members of the board of examiners take part in the deliberations.</p><p><a name="p0085"><!----></a>(4) Following the oral examination the examiners mark the presentation and the group interview in accordance with section 7a (5). If the marks awarded differ, the average is taken. The board of examiners then announces the marks to the examinee. A more detailed explanation of the marks awarded may only be requested right away and is only to be given orally.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0086">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0086"><!----></a>Section 7d<br />Notification; certificate; appeal</p><p><a name="p0087"><!----></a>(1) Notification of the result of the professional examination for notaries is to be served on the examinee.

Where the notary acted out of negligence, that notary may be held liable only if the injured parties are unable to secure compensation in another manner; however, that does not apply to official functions of the types referred to in sections 23 and 24 in the relationship between notaries and their clients.

If the notary left the trainee notary to perform the business independently, the notary is jointly and severally liable in addition to the trainee; in the relationship between the notary and the trainee notary the trainee alone is liable. The employment relationship between the trainee and the state (section 7 (3)) does not establish any liability on the part of the state.

The insurance must be taken out with an insurance company which is authorised to do business in Germany at the general conditions of insurance submitted in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Supervision Act (<i>Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz</i>). The insurance must cover all the risks of liability to be insured pursuant to sentence 1 and each individual breach of official duty which may give rise to liability claims against the notary.</p><p><a name="p0209"><!----></a>(2) The insurance cover may exclude liability for</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0210"><!----></a>1.  claims for compensation on the ground of an intentional breach of official duty,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0211"><!----></a>2.  claims for compensation resulting from activities pursued in connection with the provision of advice about non-European law, unless the breach of official duty consists in the possibility of applicability of that law not having been recognised,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0212"><!----></a>3.  claims for compensation based on misappropriation by members of the notary&#8217;s staff, unless the notary is liable on account of a negligent breach of his or her official duty to supervise staff.</p><p><a name="p0213"><!----></a>Where, following a breach of official duty, the only contentious issue is whether the ground for the exclusion under no. 1 exists, and the professional indemnity insurer therefore refuses to regulate the matter, the insurer must nevertheless pay the minimum insurance cover up to the amount applicable to the insurer covering the damages for intentional acts. If the professional indemnity insurer satisfies the party entitled to compensation, the entitled party&#8217;s claim against the notary, the chamber of notaries, the insurer pursuant to section 67 (3) no. 3 or another party entitled to compensation passes to it. The professional indemnity insurer may also demand compensation for its expenses from persons for whose obligations it is liable pursuant to sentence 2 in the same way as from a client.</p><p><a name="p0214"><!----></a>(3) The minimum insurance cover is 500,000 euros for each insured event. The benefits paid by the insurer for all losses incurred in one insurance year may be limited to double the amount of the minimum insurance cover. The insurance contract must oblige the insured party to notify the <i>Land</i> department of justice and the chamber of notaries without delay of the start and the end or termination of the insurance contract and of any change to the insurance contract which affects the prescribed insurance cover. It may be agreed in the insurance contract that all breaches of official duty in the performance of a single item of official business based either on the conduct of the notary or of an assistant whom that notary enlists may be regarded as one insured event.</p><p><a name="p0215"><!----></a>(4) It is permissible to agree an excess of no more than 1 per cent of the minimum insurance cover.</p><p><a name="p0216"><!----></a>(5) The competent agency within the meaning of section 117 (2) of the Insurance Contract Act (<i>Versicherungsvertragsgesetz</i>) is the <i>Land</i> department of justice.</p><p><a name="p0217"><!----></a>(6) Upon the application of third parties and in order that they may assert claims for compensation, the <i>Land</i> department of justice or the chamber of notaries of which the notary is a member supplies the name and address of the notary&#8217;s professional indemnity insurance and the insurance number, unless the notary has an overriding interest worth protecting in the information not being supplied; this also applies where the notarial function has expired.</p><p><a name="p0218"><!----></a>(7) (repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0219">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0219"><!----></a>Division 3<br />Notarial functions</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0220">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0220"><!----></a>Section 20<br />Notarial recording and authentication</p><p><a name="p0221"><!----></a>(1) Notaries are responsible for the notarial recording of all manner of documents and for certifying signatures, qualified electronic signatures, manual signs and copies.

A further deputy, including a permanent deputy, may be appointed for the period in which the permanent deputy is also absent or unable to carry out his or her duties. Further, in the event of the appointment of a permanent deputy, a further deputy, including a permanent deputy, may be appointed for a trainee notary assigned to a notary.</p><p><a name="p0314"><!----></a>(2) In the event of a notary being suspended from office, a deputy may also be appointed ex officio.

Section 51a applies accordingly. The chamber of notaries and supervisory authority are to be notified of the fact that the deposit in safe custody with another notary has been made.

The penalty payment accrues to the chamber of notaries; it is collected in the same way as outstanding membership dues.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0579">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0579"><!----></a>Section 75<br />Admonition</p><p><a name="p0580"><!----></a>(1) Chambers of notaries are authorised to admonish those notaries and trainee notaries who have committed a minor breach of official duty. Chambers of notaries are to notify the supervisory authority of having instituted proceedings directed at the issuing of an admonition. If the supervisory authority wishes to take over the proceedings, it is to notify the chamber of notaries thereof. A chamber of notaries&#8217; power as per sentence 1 ends upon the institution of proceedings against a notary or trainee notary under section 94 or of disciplinary proceedings. Section 95a (1) sentence 1 applies to limitation.</p><p><a name="p0581"><!----></a>(2) The notary or trainee notary is to be heard before an admonition is issued.</p><p><a name="p0582"><!----></a>(3) The admonition must be reasoned. It is to be served on the notary or trainee notary. The supervisory authority is to be sent a copy.</p><p><a name="p0583"><!----></a>(4) The notary or trainee notary may file a written objection to the admonition with the executive board of the chamber of notaries within one month following service. The executive board decides on the objection; subsection (3) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0584"><!----></a>(5) If the objection is rejected by the executive board, then the notary or trainee notary may apply to the higher regional court, sitting as the disciplinary court for notaries, for a decision. The application must be made in writing within one month following service of the decision on the objection and must be reasoned. The higher regional court takes a final decision by order. In all other respects, the provisions of the Federal Disciplinary Act (<i>Bundesdisziplinargesetz</i>) on disciplinary proceedings before the administrative courts apply accordingly to the court proceedings. Insofar as the costs of the proceedings are imposed on the service employer under these provisions, the chamber of notaries takes the place of the service employer.</p><p><a name="p0585"><!----></a>(6) An admonition is without prejudice to the supervisory authority&#8217;s right to institute disciplinary proceedings. If, however, the higher regional court has revoked the admonition because it has found no culpable breach of official duty, then the exercise of disciplinary authority on account of the same conduct is permissible only on the basis of such facts or evidence as were not known to the court when it gave its decision. If a disciplinary measure is imposed against the notary or trainee notary, any previous admonition becomes ineffective.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0586">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0586"><!----></a>Division 2<br />Federal Chamber of Notaries</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0587">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0587"><!----></a>Section 76<br />Formation; seat</p><p><a name="p0588"><!----></a>(1) The chambers of notaries together constitute the Federal Chamber of Notaries.</p><p><a name="p0589"><!----></a>(2) The seat of the Federal Chamber of Notaries is determined in its by-laws.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0590">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0590"><!----></a>Section 77<br />Legal status; supervision; approval of by-laws</p><p><a name="p0591"><!----></a>(1) The Federal Chamber of Notaries is a corporation under public law.</p><p><a name="p0592"><!----></a>(2) The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection exercises state supervision over the Federal Chamber of Notaries.

Notaries are, further, required to grant them access to those devices used to automatically process personal data and to provide them with the information necessary for supervisory purposes. Section 78i remains unaffected. Persons with whom a notary has or had a joint practice or with whom a notary shares or shared business premises are obliged to provide the supervisory authority with information and to present records and registers insofar as this is necessary to verify compliance with the prohibitions of participation. The same applies to third parties with whom a notary has or had a joint practice within the meaning of section 27 (1) sentence 2.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0835">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0835"><!----></a>Section 94<br />Disapproval</p><p><a name="p0836"><!----></a>(1) The supervisory authorities are authorised to express their disapproval of those notaries and trainee notaries who have committed a minor breach of official duty.

They are chosen from the list of proposed candidates which the executive board of the relevant chamber of notaries submits to the <i>Land</i> department of justice. The <i>Land</i> department of justice determines how many associate judges are necessary; it is to first hear the executive board of the chamber of notaries. The list of proposed candidates drawn up by the executive board of the chamber of notaries must contain at least one and a half times the required number of notaries.

If no main focus of the breach of official duties is discernible or there is no link between the breach of official duties and the exercise of a profession, then a decision is first to be given in the disciplinary proceedings if the lawyer commissioned as notary is principally engaged in the activities of a notary.</p><p><a name="p0919"><!----></a>(2) Where the lawyer commissioned as notary&#8217;s removal from office is considered a possibility, a decision may always be given in the context of disciplinary proceedings.</p><p><a name="p0920"><!----></a>(3) The subject matter of the decision given in the disciplinary proceedings is always only the breach of official duties incumbent upon the lawyer commissioned as notary.</p><p><a name="p0921"><!----></a>(4) If no decision is first to be given in disciplinary proceedings in accordance with subsection (1), then such disciplinary proceedings are only to be conducted following the conclusion of those proceedings which are to be conducted first if it appears necessary, in addition, to induce the lawyer commissioned as notary to fulfil his or her official duties.
