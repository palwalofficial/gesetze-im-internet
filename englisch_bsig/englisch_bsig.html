Before publishing warnings about these products, the makers of the products concerned shall be informed in advance, as long as doing so will not interfere with achieving the intended aim of the warning. Where security gaps or harmful software should not be made public in order to prevent their further distribution or unlawful exploitation, or because the Federal Office is bound to confidentiality with regard to third parties, the Federal Office may use objective criteria to limit the persons to be warned; in particular, a special threat to certain facilities or the exceptional reliability of the recipient may constitute objective criteria.</p><p><a name="p0093"><!----></a>(2) To fulfil its tasks under Section 3 (1) second sentence no. 14, the Federal Office may include the name of the product concerned and its manufacturer in its public warnings of security gaps in information technology products and services and of harmful software or may recommend security measures and the use of specific security products, if there are sufficient indications of threat to the security of information technology. If the published information later proves to be false or the circumstances on which it was based were misrepresented, this shall be published without delay.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0094">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0094"><!----></a>Section 8<br />Federal Office guidelines </p><p><a name="p0095"><!----></a>(1) The Federal Office may set minimum standards for ensuring the security of federal information technology. With the approval of the Council of Chief Information Officers of the federal ministries, the Federal Ministry of the Interior may issue the standards set in accordance with the first sentence in full or in part as general administrative regulations for all federal bodies. Where Federal Office security standards for interministerial networks and security requirements necessary to protect the relevant network and which are to be implemented by network users are included in a general administrative regulation, these standards shall be set with the agreement of the Council of Chief Information Officers of the federal ministries. For the courts and constitutional bodies referred to in Section 2 (3) second sentence, regulations in accordance with this subsection shall have the status of recommendations.</p><p><a name="p0096"><!----></a>(2) As part of its tasks under Section 3 (1) second sentence no. 10, the Federal Office shall provide technical guidelines which the federal bodies shall take into account as a framework for developing appropriate requirements for contractors (suitability) and IT products (specifications) when conducting contract award procedures.

IT security products developed by the Federal Office may be made available only in justified exceptional cases. The provisions of public procurement law shall remain unaffected. When the Federal Office provides IT security products, the federal authorities may request these products from the Federal Office. The Council of Chief Information Officers of the federal ministries may decide that the federal authorities shall be required to request these products from the Federal Office. In this case, other federal authorities may procure their own products only when their specific requirements make the use of other products necessary.
