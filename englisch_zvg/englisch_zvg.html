If the order for the enforced auction is served on the lessee or usufructuary lessee, upon service the seizure is deemed to be known to the lessee or usufructuary lessee; service is effected upon application by the creditor on those persons designated by him or her. As a general rule, the order must include instructions on the significance of the seizure for the lessee or usufructuary lessee. Upon the application of the creditor, the court is to cause an investigation to be made to identify the lessees and usufructuary lessees of a plot of real estate; to this end it may direct a bailiff or another civil servant or request a communication from the competent local authority as to the lessees and usufructuary lessees known to it.</p><p><a name="p0245"><!----></a>(2) Seizure for the purpose of the enforced auction is to have the same effect as seizure for the purpose of receivership if it has continued until the knockdown.
