If the authority holding the Register establishes the incorrectness of specific data, it is required to request the notifying agency to supply the correct data. In both cases the authority holding the Register must correct the incorrect entry. The notifying agency and agencies which have demonstrably been provided with incorrect information are to be notified thereof, unless the incorrectness of the data is obvious. The notifying agency need not be informed if more than 10 years have elapsed since notification was made under sentence 1. This does not apply in the case of the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life and in the case of the ordering of placement in preventive detention or in a psychiatric hospital.
