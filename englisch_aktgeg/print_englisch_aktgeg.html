The currency in which their capital stock and their shares of stock must be denominated is governed by the special provisions applying to them.</p><p><a name="p0017"><!----></a>(2) Stock corporations that have been entered in the Commercial Register prior to 1 January 1999 may continue to designate the nominal amounts of their capital stock and their shares of stock in Deutsche marks. Until 31 December 2001, stock corporations whose capital stock and shares of stock are denominated in Deutsche marks may be newly entered in the Commercial Register. Thereafter, stock corporations may be entered in the Commercial Register only if the nominal amounts of the capital stock and shares of stock are designated in euros; the same applies to resolutions regarding a change of the capital stock.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0018">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0018"><!----></a>Section 2<br />Minimum nominal amount of the capital stock</p><p><a name="p0019"><!----></a>For stock corporations that have been entered in the Commercial Register prior to 1 January 1999, or regarding which an application for entry in the Commercial Register has been filed, the minimum amount of the capital stock valid until that time continues to govern until the nominal amounts of shares of stock are brought in line with the amounts defined in section 8 of the Stock Corporation Act that are applicable from that point in time onwards. For companies formed at a later time, the minimum amount of the capital stock defined in section 7 of the Stock Corporation Act in the version applicable from 1 January 1999 governs, which in the case of formations in Deutsche marks is to be converted to Deutsche marks at the exchange rate irrevocably fixed by the Council of the European Union in accordance with Article 109l (4) sentence 1 of the Treaty on European Union.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0020">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0020"><!----></a>Section 3<br />Minimum nominal amount of the shares</p><p><a name="p0021"><!----></a>(1) Henceforth, shares of stock may be issued only in accordance with section 8 of the Stock Corporation Act.</p><p><a name="p0022"><!----></a>(2) Shares of stock in a company entered in the Commercial Register prior to 1 January 1999, or for whom an application for entry in the Commercial Register was filed and for whom an entry was made therein by 31 December 2001, may continue to be denominated in a nominal amount admissible under the provisions applicable until that time; however, shares of stock issued on the basis of a resolution to increase the capital may be so denominated only if this resolution was entered in the Commercial Register by 31 December 2001. This applies only uniformly for all of a company&#8217;s shares of stock. The nominal amounts also may be expressed in euros at the exchange rate irrevocably fixed by the Council of the European Union in accordance with Article 109l (4) sentence 1 of the Treaty on European Union.</p><p><a name="p0023"><!----></a>(3) For stock corporations entered in the Commercial Register by 31 December 2001 on the basis of an application made after 31 December 1998, and whose capital stock and shares of stock are denominated in Deutsche marks in accordance with section 1 (2) sentence 2, the amounts defined in section 8 of the Stock Corporation Act in the version applicable from 1 January 1999 onwards apply, which are to be converted into Deutsche marks at the exchange rate irrevocably fixed by the Council of the European Union in accordance with Article 109l (4) sentence 1 of the Treaty on European Union.</p><p><a name="p0024"><!----></a>(4) The relationship <i>inter se</i> of the rights attaching to the shares of stock and the ratio of their nominal amounts to the nominal capital is not affected by the conversion between Deutsche marks and euros. Fractions of nominal amounts of shares of stock resulting from the conversion can be rounded to a minimum of two decimal places; this rounding has no legal effect. Reference is to be made to it in resolutions and in the by-laws; as a rule, the stake the share of stock respectively constitutes in the capital stock is to remain recognisable.</p><p><a name="p0025"><!----></a>(5) Where a company that has not adjusted the nominal amounts of its shares of stock to section 8 of the Stock Corporation Act in the version applicable from 1 January 1999 resolves to change its capital stock, this resolution may be entered in the Commercial Register after 31 December 2001 only if, concurrently, an amendment of the by-laws as to the nominal amounts of shares of stock being adjusted to section 8 of the Stock Corporation Act is entered in same.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0026">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0026"><!----></a>Section 4<br />Procedure of changeover to the euro</p><p><a name="p0027"><!----></a>(1) In derogation from section 179 (2) of the Stock Corporation Act, the general meeting resolves, by the simple majority of the capital stock represented at the time the resolution is adopted, on the changeover to the euro of the capital stock and of the nominal amounts of shares of stock as well as of further statements of amounts as per the by-laws, doing so at the exchange rate irrevocably fixed in accordance with Article 109l (4) sentence 1 of the Treaty on European Union. From 1 January 2002 onwards, the supervisory board has authority to amend the wording of the by-laws accordingly. Section 181 (1) sentences 2 and 3 of the Stock Corporation Act is not to be applied to the application for entry of the changeover in the Commercial Register and its entry therein.</p><p><a name="p0028"><!----></a>(2) In derogation from section 207 (2), section 182 (1) and section 222 (1) of the Stock Corporation Act, it suffices, for a capital increase using company funds or for a reduction of the capital to the amount in full euros immediately above or below the amount resulting from a changeover to the euro of the nominal amounts of the shares of stock, for the resolution to be adopted by the simple majority of the capital stock represented at the time of its adoption; in the case of a reduction of the capital, however, this will suffice only if no less than half of the capital stock is represented. This majority governs also for resolutions regarding the corresponding adjustment of an authorised capital or regarding the subdivision of the shares of stock changed over to full euros, as well as for amendments of the by-laws&#8217; wording where such resolutions are tied to the change of capital. Section 130 (1) sentence 3 of the Stock Corporation Act does not apply.</p><p><a name="p0029"><!----></a>(3) A capital increase using company funds or a reduction of the capital in the course of the changeover to the euro may be effected by increasing or reducing the nominal amount of the shares of stock or by reclassifying the nominal amounts of the shares of stock. The reclassification of the nominal amounts requires the consent of all stockholders affected to whom full shares of stock are allocated that do not correspond to their equity share, or to whom a lower number of shares of stock is allocated than was previously the case; a reclassification is ruled out in the case of partly paid shares of stock.</p><p><a name="p0030"><!----></a>(4) If shares of stock have been issued out of contingent capital following a resolution to increase the capital stock using company funds, or a resolution regarding some other amendment of the by-laws serving the changeover to the euro that is tied to the number of the shares of stock, then for purposes of the resolution, such shares of stock will be considered as having been issued only after the resolution has been entered in the Commercial Register. Said shares of stock issued out of contingent capital and shares of stock yet to be issued participate in the change of the nominal amounts.</p><p><a name="p0031"><!----></a>(5) In derogation from section 208 (1) sentence 2 and section 150 (3) of the Stock Corporation Act, the capital reserve and the legal reserve as well as the allocations made to same, also insofar as they do not exceed one tenth or the greater portion of the capital stock thus far as defined in the by-laws, may be converted to capital stock for purposes of a capital increase using company funds in accordance with subsection (2). Section 229 (2) of the Stock Corporation Act does not apply to a capital reduction in accordance with subsection (2) that is intended to be carried out in simplified form.</p><p><a name="p0032"><!----></a>(6) Section 73 (1) sentence 2 of the Stock Corporation Act does not apply. In all other cases, the provisions of the laws governing stock corporations remain unaffected.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0033">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0033"><!----></a>Section 5<br />Multiple voting rights; maximum voting rights</p><p><a name="p0034"><!----></a>(1) If multiple voting rights have expired in accordance with section 5 (1) of the version of the present Act in force until and including 14 December 2023, or if they have been cancelled in accordance with section 5 (2) of the version in force until and including 14 December 2023, then section 5 (3) to (6) of the version in force until and including 14 December 2023 applies.</p><p><a name="p0035"><!----></a>(2) If it has been resolved in accordance with section 5 (1) sentence 1 of the version in force until and including 14 December 2023 that multiple-vote shares are to continue to be valid, then the provisions of section 135a (1) sentence 2 and (2) of the Stock Corporation Act only apply to such shares from that point in time after 15 December 2023 onwards at which the company is listed on the stock exchange within the meaning of section 3 (2) of the Stock Corporation Act or at which the company&#8217;s stock is included for trading on the regulated unofficial market in accordance with section 48 of the Stock Exchange Act (<i>Börsengesetz</i>); the limitation to registered shares of stock stipulated in section 135a (1) sentence 1 of the Stock Corporation Act does not apply.</p><p><a name="p0036"><!----></a>(3) Sentences 2 to 5 of section 134 (1) of the Stock Corporation Act in the version applicable prior to 1 May 1998 continue to apply until 1 June 2000 to maximum voting rights in listed companies where such maximum voting rights have been determined in the by-laws prior to 1 May 1998.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0037">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0037"><!----></a>Section 6<br />Cross-shareholding enterprises</p><p><a name="p0038"><!----></a>(1) Where, as early as at the time the Stock Corporation Act enters into force, a stock corporation and another enterprise are cross-shareholding enterprises without the pre-requisites defined in section 19 (2) or (3) of the Stock Corporation Act having been met, and where both enterprises have filed, in due time (section 7), the notification under section 20 (3) or under section 21 (1) of the Stock Corporation Act, section 328 (1) and (2) of the Stock Corporation Act does not apply to them.</p><p><a name="p0039"><!----></a>(2) As long as the enterprises are cross-shareholding enterprises without the pre-requisites defined in section 19 (2) or (3) of the Stock Corporation Act having been met, the following applies instead to the exercise of the rights attaching to the shares of the other enterprise:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0040"><!----></a>1.  All rights attaching to the shares that belonged to the enterprises at the time the Stock Corporation Act entered into force, or attaching to the shares that are allocated to said shares in the event of a capital increase using company funds, may be exercised.</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0041"><!----></a>2.  All rights, to the exception of the voting right, attaching to the shares that are acquired in the event of a capital increase in return for contributions on the basis of a pre-emptive right for newly issued shares of stock existing in accordance with no. 1 may be exercised; the same applies to shares that are allocated to said shares in the event of a capital increase using company funds.</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0042"><!----></a>3.  To the exception of the right to new shares of stock in the event of a capital increase using company funds, no rights attaching to other shares may be exercised.</p><p><a name="p0043"><!----></a>(3) Where only one of the cross-shareholding enterprises has filed, in due time (section 7), the notification under section 20 (3) or under section 21 (1) of the Stock Corporation Act, section 328 (1) and (2) does not apply to that enterprise.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0044">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0044"><!----></a>Section 7<br />Notification obligation regarding ownership interests</p><p><a name="p0045"><!----></a>The notification obligations defined in sections 20, 21 and 328 (3) of the Stock Corporation Act apply also to ownership interests in existence at the time the Stock Corporation Act enters into force.
