The liability for payment of tax is equivalent to the tax liability; it is not accessory in relation to the tax liability of the policyholder. A liable party may be held liable for the tax by means of a tax assessment notice or notice of liability. To define a taxpayer&#8217;s period for assessment under sections 169 to 171 of the Fiscal Code, in each instance those circumstances that exist in relation to the person are the relevant ones; in particular, in the case of holding the tax payment debtor liable for the tax, the expiry of the period for assessment for the policyholder is irrelevant, and, in the case of holding the liable party liable for the tax, the expiry of the period for assessment for the tax payment debtor is irrelevant.</p><p><a name="p0103"><!----></a>(9) In the relationship between the insurer and the policyholder, the tax is deemed to constitute part of the insurance premium to the extent that the collection and legal enforcement of the tax are involved.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0104">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0104"><!----></a>Section 7a<br />Jurisdiction</p><p><a name="p0105"><!----></a>The Federal Central Tax Office has jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0106">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0106"><!----></a>Section 8<br />Tax return, due date</p><p><a name="p0107"><!----></a>(1) The tax payment debtor under section 7 (2), (3), (4) or (5) must, within 15 days of the end of each tax return period:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0108"><!----></a>1.  file a tax return using an officially prescribed data set via remote data transmission in which they must themselves calculate the tax which has been incurred in the tax return period (self-assessed tax return), and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0109"><!----></a>2.  pay over the tax which has arisen in the tax return period.</p><p><a name="p0110"><!----></a>To avoid undue hardship, the Federal Central Tax Office may waive electronic transmission upon request; in such cases, the tax payment debtor must file the tax return using the officially prescribed form.</p><p><a name="p0111"><!----></a>(2) The tax return period is the calendar month.
