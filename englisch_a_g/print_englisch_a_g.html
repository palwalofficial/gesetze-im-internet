Employees are assigned to perform work if they are integrated into the work organisation of the user undertaking and subjected to its instructions. The assignment and deployment of employees as temporary agency workers is only permissible as long as an employment relationship exists between the temporary work agency and the temporary agency worker. The temporary assignment of employees is permissible up to a maximum duration pursuant to subsection (1b). In their contract, temporary work agencies and user undertakings must expressly designate the assignment of temporary agency workers as temporary agency work before temporary agency workers are assigned or deployed. Prior to assignment, they must set out the personal details of temporary agency workers with reference to this contract.</p><p><a name="p0015"><!----></a>(1a) The secondment of employees to a consortium established for the creation of a product does not constitute temporary agency work if the employer is a member of the consortium, collective agreements of the same industry branch apply to all members of the consortium and all members are committed by the consortium agreement to the independent provision of contractual services. For an employer with registered office in another Member State of the European Economic Area, the secondment of employees to a consortium established for the creation of a product also does not constitute temporary agency work, if German collective agreements of the same industry branch as for the other members of the consortium do not apply to said employer but the other prerequisites of sentence 1 are fulfilled.</p><p><a name="p0016"><!----></a>(1b) The temporary work agency may not assign the same temporary agency worker to the same user undertaking for more than 18 consecutive months; the user undertaking may not deploy the same temporary agency worker for more than 18 consecutive months. The period of previous assignments by the same or another temporary work agency to the same user undertaking is to be counted in full, if the period between individual assignments does not exceed three months. A maximum assignment period in derogation from sentence 1 can be set out in a collective agreement concluded by collective agreement parties of the deployment sector. Derogating collective agreement provisions can be adopted within the scope of application of a collective agreement in accordance with sentence 3 at user undertakings not bound by collective agreement by way of a company-level or public service agreement. A maximum assignment period in derogation from sentence 1 can be set out in a company-level or public service agreement reached on the basis of a collective agreement concluded by collective agreement parties of the deployment sector. If it is possible on the basis of a collective agreement in accordance with sentence 5 for derogating provisions to be agreed in a company-level or public service agreement, these can also be applied at user undertakings not bound by collective agreement for up to a maximum assignment period of 24 months as long as no maximum assignment period for company-level and public service agreements in derogation from sentence 1 is set out in this collective agreement. If the user undertaking not bound by collective agreement falls within the scope of application of multiple collective agreements upon conclusion of a company-level or public service agreement pursuant to sentence 4 or sentence 6, the collective agreement representative for the user undertaking&#8217;s sector is to be drawn upon. Churches and religious groups under public law may stipulate maximum assignment periods in their provisions that deviate from sentence 1.</p><p><a name="p0017"><!----></a>(2) If employees are assigned to third parties to perform work and the assigning party does not assume the customary employer obligations or employer risk (section 3 (1) nos. 1 to 3), it is assumed that the assigning party is conducting job placement.</p><p><a name="p0018"><!----></a>(3) With the exception of section 1b sentence 1, section 16 (1) no. 1f and (2) to (5) and sections 17 and 18, this Act is not to be applied to temporary agency work</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0019"><!----></a>1.  between employers of the same industry branch to avoid short-time work or redundancies if a collective agreement applicable to the user undertaking and the temporary work agency provides for this,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0020"><!----></a>2.  between affiliate companies within the meaning of section 18 of the Stock Corporation Act <i>(Aktiengesetz)</i> if the employee is not hired and employed for the purpose of the assignment,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0021"><!----></a>2a.  between employers if the assignment only takes place occasionally and the employee is not hired and employed for the purpose of the assignment,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0022"><!----></a>2b.  between employers if duties of an employee are transferred from the existing to another employer and by virtue of a public service collective agreement</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0023"><!----></a>a)  the employment relationship with the existing employer remains in force and</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0024"><!----></a>b)  the work is in future performed for another employer,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0025"><!----></a>2c.  between employers if these are legal entities under public law and apply public service collective agreements or provisions of religious groups under public law, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0026"><!----></a>3.  abroad if the temporary agency worker is assigned to a German-overseas joint enterprise founded on the basis of intergovernmental agreements in which the temporary work agency is involved.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0027">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0027"><!----></a>Section 1a<br />Notification of assignment</p><p><a name="p0028"><!----></a>(1) An employer with fewer than 50 employees that assigns an employee not hired and employed for the purpose of the assignment to an employer for a period of up to 12 months in order to avoid short-time work or redundancies does not require a permit if the assignment is previously notified in writing to the Federal Employment Agency.</p><p><a name="p0029"><!----></a>(2) The notification must specify</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0030"><!----></a>1.  first and last names, place of residence and address, date and place of birth of the temporary agency worker,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0031"><!----></a>2.  type of activity to be performed by the temporary agency worker and any duty to work elsewhere,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0032"><!----></a>3.  start and duration of the assignment,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0033"><!----></a>4.  company and address of the user undertaking.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0034">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0034"><!----></a>Section 1b<br />Restrictions in the construction sector</p><p><a name="p0035"><!----></a>Temporary agency work in accordance with section 1 at construction sector establishments for work that is normally carried out by workers is prohibited.

The proposal must contain uniform minimum hourly wages for assignment periods and non-assignment periods and a duration. The proposal must be justified in writing.</p><p><a name="p0056"><!----></a>(2) The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs can, if this seems necessary in the public interest, determine in a statutory instrument not requiring the approval of the Bundesrat that the proposed collectively agreed minimum hourly wages in accordance with subsection (1) are to apply to all employers and temporary agency workers falling within the scope of application of the statutory instrument as a binding wage floor.

In case of imminent danger, the persons commissioned by the approval authority may conduct the necessary searches during business hours without a judicial order.

Within the scope of application of such a collective agreement, employers and employees not bound by collective agreement can agree to apply the collective agreement.

The employment relationship in accordance with sentence 1 is deemed temporary if the activity of the temporary agency worker for the user undertaking was only intended to be temporary and there is an objectively justifiable reason for this to be the case. The working hours agreed between the temporary work agency and the user undertaking are the agreed working hours for the employment relationship pursuant to sentence 1. In all other cases the content and duration of this employment relationship are determined according to the provisions and other regulations prevailing at the user undertaking, in the absence of which those of comparable companies apply.

Non-German temporary agency workers are to receive the leaflet and the proof pursuant to (1) in their mother tongue on request. The costs of the leaflet are borne by the temporary work agency.
