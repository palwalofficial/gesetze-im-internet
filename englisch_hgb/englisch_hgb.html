Liabilities are to be recognised at the amount of the performance of the obligation and provisions are to be recognised at the amount that, when assessed exercising reasonable business judgment, will be necessary to settle the liability. Insofar as the amount of old-age pension scheme obligations exclusively is determined based on the fair value of investment securities within the meaning of section 266 (2) A. III. 5, provisions are to be recognised at the fair value of said investment securities, insofar as said value exceeds a guaranteed minimum amount. Assets to be set off pursuant to section 246 (2) sentence 2 are to be valued at their fair value. Micro share capital companies (section 267a) may base valuations on the fair value only if they have not taken recourse to any of the eased requirements provided for by section 264 (1) sentence 5 section 266 (1) sentence 4 section 275 (5) and section 326 (2). Where a micro share capital company takes recourse to at least one of the eased requirements set out in sentence 5, the assets are to be valued pursuant to sentence 1, also where offsetting is to be performed pursuant to section 246 (2) sentence 2.</p><p><a name="p0825"><!----></a>(2) Provisions having a remaining term of more than one year are to be discounted at the market interest rate corresponding to their remaining term, averaged over the preceding ten financial years in the case of provisions formed for old-age pension scheme obligations, and averaged over the preceding seven financial years in the case of provisions formed for other purposes. In derogation from sentence 1, provisions for old-age pension scheme obligations or comparable obligations falling due in the long term may be discounted at a blanket rate, this being the average market interest rate resulting if a remaining term of 15 years is assumed. Sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly to liabilities based on pension obligations for which no counterperformance is to be expected going forward. Deutsche Bundesbank defines the discounting rate to be applied pursuant to sentences 1 and 2, subject to the stipulations of a statutory instrument, and discloses it at monthly intervals. In the statutory instrument pursuant to sentence 4, which is not subject to approval by the Bundesrat, the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection determines, after having consulted with Deutsche Bundesbank, the details of defining the discounting rates, particularly the methods used for such definition and their foundations, as well as the form in which they are to be published by notice.</p><p><a name="p0826"><!----></a>(3) In reporting assets forming part of the fixed assets, the use of which is limited in time, the cost of acquisition or the production cost is to be reduced by scheduled depreciations. The schedule must allocate the cost of acquisition or production cost to those financial years in which it foreseeably will be possible to use the asset. If it is not possible, in exceptional cases, to reliably estimate the foreseeable useful life of an intangible asset created by the undertaking itself and forming part of the fixed assets, then the schedule is to provide for a depreciation of the production cost over a period of ten years. Sentence 3 applies accordingly to goodwill acquired for valuable consideration. Regardless of whether the useful life of any assets forming part of the fixed assets is limited in time, unscheduled depreciations are to be performed for these assets if a permanent impairment of their value is to be expected, in order to recognise them at the lower value attributable to them as per the balance sheet date. In the case of financial assets, unscheduled depreciations may be performed also in the event of a value impairment that is not expected to be permanent. </p><p><a name="p0827"><!----></a>(4) Depreciations are to be performed for assets reported under current assets in order to recognise them at a lower value where this results from their trading price or market price as given on the balance sheet date. Where it is not possible to determine a trading price or market price and where the cost of acquisition or production cost exceeds the value attributable to the assets on the balance sheet date, the depreciation is to be performed such that it reflects that value.</p><p><a name="p0828"><!----></a>(5) A value recognised at a lower rate pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 5 or 6 and pursuant to subsection (4) may not be upheld if the grounds for which it was applied have ceased to exist. A value recognised at a lower rate for goodwill acquired for valuable consideration is to be upheld.</p><p><a name="p0829"><!----></a>(6) In the case of provisions formed for old-age pension scheme obligations, the difference between the value recognised for the provisions based on the corresponding market interest rate averaged over the preceding ten financial years and the value recognised for the provisions based on the corresponding market interest rate averaged over the preceding seven financial years is to be identified in every financial year. Profits may be distributed only if the reserves remaining freely disposable after the distribution, plus the accumulated profits carried forward and minus the accumulated losses carried forward, correspond at a minimum to the difference pursuant to sentence 1.

The cost of acquisition also includes the incidental expenses as well as the expenses incurred subsequent to the acquisition. Where it is possible to attribute reductions in the acquisition price to the asset on an individual basis, they are to be deducted.</p><p><a name="p0834"><!----></a>(2) The term &#8220;production cost&#8221; designates the expenditures incurred for the consumption of goods and for the use of services in order to produce an asset, to expand it or to improve it materially beyond its original state. This includes cost of materials, the manufacturing cost and the special expenses directly attributable to the manufactured goods, as well as a reasonable proportion of the materials overheads, manufacturing overheads and the attrition of the fixed assets&#8217; value, insofar as such attrition is caused by the manufacturing process. In calculating the production cost, a reasonable proportion of the general administrative expenses as well as reasonable expenditures for social services of the operation, for voluntary employee benefits and for the company old-age pension scheme may be included in this item to the extent that they relate to the period of production.

The term &#8220;research&#8221; designates the independent and systematic search for new scientific or technical insights or experiences of a general nature, the technical usability and economic viability of which are fundamentally impossible to assess. Where it is impossible to distinguish research and development from one another in reliable fashion, they may not be posted as assets.</p><p><a name="p0836"><!----></a>(3) Interest for third-party capital does not form part of the production cost.

The legal representatives of a publicly traded share capital company that is not obliged to draw up consolidated financial statements are to supplement the annual financial statements by a statement of cash flows and statement of changes in equity forming a single whole together with the balance sheet, profit and loss account and the notes; they may supplement the annual financial statements by segment reporting. The legal representatives are to draw up the annual financial statements and the management report within the first three months of the financial year for the past financial year. Small share capital companies (section 267 (1)) are not required to draw up a management report; they may draw up the annual financial statements also at a later point in time if this is commensurate with the due and proper course of business, but must do so within the first six months of the financial year. Micro share capital companies (section 267a) are not required to supplement the annual financial statements by notes if they provide the following at the foot of the balance sheet: </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0874"><!----></a>1.  the information set out in section 268 (7),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0875"><!----></a>2.  the information set out in section 285, no. 9, letter c, and,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0876"><!----></a>3.  if they are a stock corporation, the information set out in section 160 (3) sentence 2 of the Stock Corporation Act (<i>Aktiengesetz</i>).</p><p><a name="p0877"><!----></a>(1a) The annual financial statements are to state the business name, the seat, the court of registration and the number under which the company has been entered in the Commercial Register. Where the company is in liquidation or is in the process of being wound up, this is to be disclosed as well.</p><p><a name="p0878"><!----></a>(2) The annual financial statements of the share capital company are to present accurately the share capital company&#8217;s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss in keeping with its actual circumstances and are to comply with the principles of proper accounting. Where, due to special circumstances, the annual financial statements do not accurately present the actual circumstances within the meaning of sentence 1, additional information is to be provided in the notes. The members of the representative body of a share capital company that issues securities (section 2 (1) of the Securities Trading Act (<i>Wertpapierhandelsgesetz</i>) as a domestic issuer (section 2 (14) of the Securities Trading Act) and that is not a share capital company within the meaning of section 327a are to give an assurance in a written declaration to be attached to the annual financial statements that, to the best of their knowledge, the annual financial statements accurately present the actual circumstances within the meaning of sentence 1 or that the notes include information pursuant to sentence 2. Where a micro share capital company takes recourse to the eased requirement pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 5, the additional information required pursuant to sentence 2 is to be included at the foot of the balance sheet. The operative assumption is that annual financial statements drawn up with due regard having been had to the eased requirements for micro share capital companies are compliant with the requirements set out in sentence 1.</p><p><a name="p0879"><!----></a>(3) A share capital company that is not publicly traded within the meaning of section 264d and that, because it is a subsidiary undertaking, is included in the consolidated financial statements of its parent undertaking, such parent undertaking having its seat in a Member State of the European Union or in some other state party to the Agreement creating the European Economic Area, is not required to apply the provisions of this Subdivision and of Subdivisions 3 and 4 of this Division if all of the pre-requisites set out hereinbelow have been met: </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0880"><!----></a>1.  All of the subsidiary undertaking&#8217;s shareholders have approved the exemption for the respective financial year;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0881"><!----></a>2.  the parent undertaking has declared that it guarantees, for the subsequent financial year, the commitments entered into by the subsidiary undertaking up until the balance sheet date;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0882"><!----></a>3.  the consolidated financial statements of the parent undertaking and its consolidated management report have been drawn up and audited pursuant to the laws of the state in which the parent undertaking has its seat, and in conformity with the following Directives: </p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0883"><!----></a>a)  Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182 of 29 June 2013, p. 19), last amended by Directive 2014/102/EU (OJ L 334 of 21 November 2014, p. 86);</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0884"><!----></a>b)  Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and repealing Council Directive 84/253/EEC (OJ L 157 of 9 June 2006, p. 87), which has been amended by Directive 2013/34/EU (OJ L 182 of 29 June 2013, p. 19);</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0885"><!----></a>4.  the exemption of the subsidiary undertaking has been stated in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the parent undertaking and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0886"><!----></a>5.  the following have been disclosed with regard to the subsidiary undertaking pursuant to section 325 (1) to (1b): </p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0887"><!----></a>a)  the resolution pursuant to no. 1,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0888"><!----></a>b)  the declaration pursuant to no. 2,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0889"><!----></a>c)  the consolidated financial statements,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0890"><!----></a>d)  the consolidated management report and  </p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0891"><!----></a>e)  the audit report on the consolidated financial statements of the parent undertaking and on its consolidated management report pursuant to no. 3.</p><p><a name="p0892"><!----></a>Where the parent undertaking has already disclosed individual or all of the documents designated in sentence 1 under no. 5, the subsidiary undertaking is not required to once again disclose the documents concerned if they are locatable in the Federal Gazette in the entry for the subsidiary undertaking; section 326 (2) does not apply to this disclosure.

Sentences 2 and 5 apply accordingly to the contributions by limited partners, whereby these contributions collectively are to be shown separately from the equity shares of the general partners.

Any difference that is greater than this amount is to be allocated to the capital reserves pursuant to subsection (2) no. 1.

This includes legal reserves to be formed from the profit, or provisions to be formed pursuant to the articles of incorporation or statutes, as well as other retained earnings. </p><p><a name="p1055"><!----></a>(4) A reserve is to be formed for shares held in a controlling undertaking or in an undertaking holding a majority participating interest. An amount is to be allocated to the reserve that corresponds to the amount recognised under assets on the balance sheet for the shares in the controlling undertaking or the undertaking holding a majority participating interest. The reserve, which is to be formed already when drawing up the balance sheet, may be formed using those freely disposable reserves that are available. The reserve is to be reversed insofar as the shares in the controlling undertaking or undertaking holding a majority participating interest are sold, issued or redeemed or if a lower amount is recognised under assets.</p><p><a name="p1056"><!----></a>(5) If the portion of the net income for the year that is attributable to a participating interest in the profit and loss account exceeds the amounts that have been received as a dividend or as a share of the profits, or if it exceeds the amounts that the share capital company is entitled to receive in payment, then the difference is to be allocated to a reserve, the distribution of which is not permissible.

Any reduction of taxes resulting in the aggregate may be recognised on the balance sheet as a deferred tax asset (section 266 (2) D.). The resulting tax burden and the resulting tax reduction also may be recognised without a set-off being performed.

Where a parent undertaking draws up consolidated financial statements for the first time, the values recognised at the time at which the subsidiary undertaking is included in the consolidated financial statements are to be taken as a basis, unless the subsidiary undertaking became a subsidiary undertaking in that year for which the consolidated financial statements are being drawn up.

The scope of the audit of the annual financial statements and of the consolidated financial statements is to cover compliance with the statutory requirements, as well as the provisions complementing them that are stipulated by the articles of incorporation or statutes. The audit is to be structured such that any instances in which the reporting is incorrect or in which the stipulations of sentence 2 are violated, such that the presentation of the share capital company&#8217;s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss resulting from section 264 (2) is significantly affected, will be recognised assuming professional due diligence is applied.</p><p><a name="p1587"><!----></a>(2) The management report and the consolidated management report are to be audited with a view to establishing whether the management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, as the case may be also with the standalone financial statements pursuant to section 325 (2a), and whether the consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, as well as with the findings made by the statutory auditor in the course of the auditor&#8217;s audit, and whether the management report accurately presents, as a whole, the position of the share capital company and whether the consolidated management report accurately presents, as a whole, the position of the group. In this context, the audit also is to address whether the opportunities and risks that may result from future developments have been presented accurately. The scope of the audit of the management report and of the consolidated management report also is to cover compliance with the statutory requirements that govern the drawing-up of management reports or of consolidated management reports. As concerns the requirements stipulated by sections 289b to 289e and sections 315b and 315c, all that is to be audited is whether the non-financial statement or the separate non-financial report, the consolidated non-financial statement or the separate consolidated non-financial report has been submitted. In the case governed by section 289b (3) sentence 1 no. 2 (b), a supplementary audit is to be performed by the same statutory auditor four months after the balance sheet date in order to establish whether the separate non-financial report or the separate consolidated non-financial report has been submitted; section 316 (3) sentence 2 applies accordingly, with the proviso that the audit report is to be supplemented only if the separate non-financial report or the separate consolidated non-financial report has not been so submitted within four months of the balance sheet date. The audit of the information provided pursuant to section 289f (2) and (5) as well as section 315d is to be restricted to establishing whether this information has been provided.</p><p><a name="p1588"><!----></a>(3) The statutory auditor of the consolidated financial statements also is to audit the annual financial statements combined in the consolidated financial statements, in particular the adjustments entailed by the consolidation, by way of applying subsection (1) accordingly. Where such annual financial statements have been audited by a different statutory auditor, the statutory auditor of the consolidated financial statements is to verify the work done by that other auditor and is to document this review.</p><p><a name="p1589"><!----></a>(3a) In the case of a share capital company that issues securities (section 2 (1) of the Securities Trading Act (<i>Wertpapierhandelsgesetz</i>) as a domestic issuer (section 2 (14) of the Securities Trading Act) and that is not a share capital company within the meaning of section 327a, the statutory auditor also is to assess in the context of the audit whether the reproduction of the annual financial statements prepared for disclosure purposes and the reproduction of the management report prepared for disclosure purposes comply with the requirements of section 328 (1). In the case of a share capital company within the meaning of sentence 1, the statutory auditor of the consolidated financial statements also is to assess in the context of the audit whether the reproduction of the consolidated financial statements prepared for disclosure purposes and the reproduction of the consolidated management report prepared for disclosure purposes comply with the requirements of section 328 (1).</p><p><a name="p1590"><!----></a>(4) In the case of a stock corporation listed on the stock exchange, moreover, it is to be assessed in the context of the audit whether the board of management has taken the measures incumbent on it pursuant to section 91 (2) of the Stock Corporation Act in suitable form and whether the monitoring system to be instituted accordingly is suited to fulfil its task.</p><p><a name="p1591"><!----></a>(4a) Unless provided for otherwise, the scope of the audit is not to cover an assurance as to the future viability of the share capital company so audited or as to the effectiveness or efficiency with which the management has conducted its affairs.</p><p><a name="p1592"><!----></a>(5) In performing an audit, the statutory auditor is to apply those international auditing standards that the European Commission has adopted in the procedure pursuant to Article 26 (3) of Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and repealing Council Directive 84/253/EEC (OJ L 157 p. 87), which was last amended by Directive 2014/56/EU (OJ L 158 of 27 May 2014, p. 196).</p><p><a name="p1593"><!----></a>(6) The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection is authorised to determine, by way of statutory instrument issued in agreement with the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy that is not subject to approval by the Bundesrat, further requirements for statutory audits in addition to the international auditing standards to be applied in performing the statutory audit pursuant to subsection (5) where this is called for by the scope of the statutory audit and serves the objectives of the audit set out in subsections (1) to (4).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1594">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1594"><!----></a>Section 318<br />Appointment of the statutory auditor; removal from office</p><p><a name="p1595"><!----></a>(1) The shareholders of an undertaking elect the statutory auditor of the annual financial statements; the shareholders of the parent undertaking elect the statutory auditor of the consolidated financial statements. In the case of limited liability companies and of general partnerships and partly limited partnerships within the meaning of section 264a (1), the articles of incorporation may determine otherwise. In each case, the statutory auditor is to be elected, as a rule, prior to expiry of that financial year that is covered by the scope of the audit activity. The legal representatives are to award the contract without undue delay following such election; where the supervisory board is competent, the supervisory board will do so. It is possible to withdraw from the audit contract only if another auditor has been appointed pursuant to subsection (3).</p><p><a name="p1596"><!----></a>(1a) Any agreement restricting the choice pursuant to subsection (1) to particular categories or lists of auditors or audit firms is null and void.</p><p><a name="p1597"><!----></a>(2) Unless some other auditor is appointed, that auditor is considered to have been appointed as the statutory auditor of the consolidated financial statements who has been engaged for the audit of the annual financial statements of the parent undertaking included in the consolidated financial statements. Where the consolidation is based on interim financial statements, then unless some other auditor is appointed, that auditor is considered to have been appointed as the statutory auditor who had been engaged for the audit of the annual financial statements of the parent undertaking drawn up before the most recent cut-off date for the consolidated financial statements.</p><p><a name="p1598"><!----></a>(3) Upon a corresponding petition being filed by the legal representatives, by the supervisory board or by shareholders, whose shares collectively make up one twentieth of the voting rights or of the subscribed capital or have a market value of 500,000 euros at the time of the petition, the court is to appoint a different statutory auditor after hearing the parties involved and the auditor appointed if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1599"><!----></a>1.  this seems to be mandated by a reason given in the person of the auditor elected, in particular if one of the preclusion criteria pursuant to section 319 (2) to (5) or pursuant to section 319b is given or if Article 5 paragraph (4) subparagraph 1 sentence 1 or paragraph (5) subparagraph 2 sentence 2 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 has been violated, or if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1600"><!----></a>2.  the regulations governing the appointment of the auditor pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or the regulations governing the audit engagement pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 527/2014 have not been complied with.</p><p><a name="p1601"><!----></a>The petition is to be filed within two weeks following the day of the statutory auditor&#8217;s election; stockholders may file such a petition only if they have raised their objection to the auditor&#8217;s election at the time the resolution was adopted. Where grounds for appointing a different statutory auditor than the auditor elected become known only after the auditor&#8217;s election, or where such grounds arise only after the auditor&#8217;s election, the petition is to be filed within two weeks following the day on which the party entitled to file the petition became aware of the circumstances giving rise to the petition, or ought to have become aware of them barring gross negligence. Where stockholders file the petition, they are to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that they have been holding the shares of stock for at least three months prior to the date on which the statutory auditor was elected. A declaration made in lieu of an oath before a notary will suffice for the purpose of such demonstration to the satisfaction of the court. Where the company is subject to supervision by the state, the supervisory authority also may file the petition. The petition no longer may be filed after the audit report has been submitted, and in the case of a supplementary audit pursuant to section 316 (3), it may no longer be filed once the audit report has been supplemented. A complaint may be lodged against the decision taken.</p><p><a name="p1602"><!----></a>(4) Where, by the expiry of the financial year, no statutory auditor has been elected, the court is to appoint the statutory auditor upon a corresponding petition having been filed by the legal representatives, the supervisory board or by a shareholder. This also will apply if a statutory auditor who has been elected has refused to accept the audit engagement, has ceased to be available or is prevented from concluding the audit in due time and no other statutory auditor has been elected. The legal representatives are under obligation to file the petition. A complaint may be lodged against the decision taken by the court; the appointment of the statutory auditor is incontestable.</p><p><a name="p1603"><!----></a>(5) The court-appointed statutory auditor is entitled to claim reimbursement of his or her reasonable cash expenses and to remuneration for his or her activity. The court determines the expenses and the remuneration. A complaint may be lodged against the decision taken by the court; a complaint on points of law is precluded. Once the court&#8217;s decision has become final and unappealable, compulsory enforcement may be pursued under the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p><a name="p1604"><!----></a>(6) Once a statutory auditor has accepted an audit engagement, the statutory auditor may terminate it solely for grave cause. Grave cause will not be deemed given in the case of differences of opinion regarding the content of the audit report, as well as regarding the issuance of a qualified or adverse opinion. The reasons for the termination are to be stated in writing. The statutory auditor is to report on the result of his or her audit up to that point; section 321 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p1605"><!----></a>(7) Where the statutory auditor terminates the audit contract pursuant to subsection (6), the legal representatives are to notify the supervisory board, the next upcoming general meeting or, in the case of limited liability companies, the shareholders of this fact. The legal representatives are to submit the report of the statutory auditor thus far mandated to the supervisory board and are to do so without undue delay. Each of the supervisory board members is entitled to obtain knowledge of the report. The report is to be handed over to each member of the supervisory board or, insofar as the supervisory board has so resolved, to the members of a committee. Where the supervisory board has engaged the statutory auditor, the duties of the legal representatives will be incumbent on the supervisory board, including the duty to notify the legal representatives.</p><p><a name="p1606"><!----></a>(8) The statutory auditor and the legal representatives of the audited company are to notify the Chamber of Public Accountants without undue delay and in writing of the fact that the audit contract has been terminated or revoked, stating the reasons therefor.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1607">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1607"><!----></a>Section 319<br />Selection of the auditors and preclusion criteria</p><p><a name="p1608"><!----></a>(1) Auditors and audit firms may be statutory auditors. Also, certified accountants and accountancy companies may serve as the statutory auditors of the annual financial statements and management reports of medium-sized limited liability companies (section 267 (2)) or of medium-sized commercial partnerships within the meaning of section 264a (1).

The statutory auditor will have the rights pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 and pursuant to subsection (2) both vis-à-vis the parent undertaking and the subsidiary undertakings, and will have the rights pursuant to subsection (2) also vis-à-vis the statutory auditors of the parent undertaking and of the subsidiary undertakings.

The report is to be prepared in writing and with the requisite clarity; at its outset, the statutory auditor is to state his or her position regarding the assessment by the legal representatives of the share capital company&#8217;s or group&#8217;s position; in particular, the assessment of the future viability and the future development of the share capital company are to be addressed with due regard being had to the management report and, where the audit relates to the consolidated financial statements of parent undertakings, also the future viability and future development of the group with due regard being had to the consolidated management report, insofar as the documents audited and the management report or the consolidated management report allow such an assessment to be made. Moreover, the statutory auditor is to report any instances of incorrect reporting or any violations of statutory requirements said auditor has established in the course of performing the audit, as well as any facts jeopardising the viability of the share capital company or group that has been audited, or that are suited to seriously prejudice its development, or that are an indication of grave violations committed by the legal representatives or employees of the law, the articles of incorporation or the statutes.</p><p><a name="p1636"><!----></a>(2) The main part of the auditor&#8217;s additional report is to establish whether the accounting records and the further documents audited, the annual financial statements, the management report, the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated management report comply with the statutory requirements and the provisions of articles of incorporation or of the statutes complementing such statutory requirements. In this context, deficiencies also are to be reported that have not caused a qualified or adverse opinion to be issued, insofar as this is relevant for monitoring the management and the audited share capital company. Furthermore, it is to be addressed whether the financial statements in their entirety accurately present the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the share capital company or of the group in keeping with its actual circumstances, in compliance with the principles of proper accounting or other relevant financial reporting frameworks. To this end, essential bases of evaluation are to be addressed, as well as the question of how changes to the bases of valuation, including the election of reporting options and valuation options and instances in which margins of appreciation were applied, as well as measures taken for purposes of accounting policy, collectively influence the presentation of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. In the process, the items of the annual financial statements and of the consolidated financial statements are to be broken down and explained in sufficient detail, insofar as the notes do not provide this information. It is to be presented whether the legal representatives have provided the clarifications and proof sought.</p><p><a name="p1637"><!----></a>(3) In a separate section of the auditor&#8217;s additional report, the audit&#8217;s subject matter, nature and scope are to be explained.

The question is to be addressed of whether measures need to be taken to improve the internal monitoring system.</p><p><a name="p1639"><!----></a>(4a) The statutory auditor is to confirm his or her independence in the auditor&#8217;s additional report.</p><p><a name="p1640"><!----></a>(5) The statutory auditor is to date and sign the report and is to submit it to the legal representatives; section 322 (7) sentences 3 and 4 applies accordingly. Were the supervisory board has awarded the contract, the report is to be submitted to the supervisory board and, concurrently, to an audit committee it has instituted. In the case governed by sentence 2, the report is to be forwarded, without undue delay after having been submitted, to the representative managing body for it to state its position.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1641">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1641"><!----></a>Section 321a<br />Disclosure of the auditor&#8217;s additional report in special cases</p><p><a name="p1642"><!----></a>(1) Where insolvency proceedings are opened regarding the assets of the company, or where the petition filed for the opening of such proceedings is refused due to lack of assets, a creditor or shareholder has the option either himself or herself or through an auditor the creditor or shareholder is to determine or, in the case governed by section 319 (1) sentence 2, through a certified accountant to inspect the auditor&#8217;s additional reports of the statutory auditor concerning the audit of the annual financial statements for the last three financial years performed based on statutory requirements, insofar as they relate to the reporting called for pursuant to section 321.

The audit report is to describe the audit&#8217;s subject matter, nature and scope while also citing the accounting standards and audit principles applied; furthermore, it is to include an assessment of the audit result. An introductory section is to describe, at a minimum, the audit&#8217;s subject matter and cite the accounting standards applied. In a separate section, the result of the audit performed in accordance with section 317 (3a) is to be reported.</p><p><a name="p1648"><!----></a>(1a) In preparing the audit report, the statutory auditor is to apply the international auditing standards adopted by the European Commission in the procedure pursuant to Article 26 (3) of Directive 2006/43/EC.</p><p><a name="p1649"><!----></a>(2) The assessment of the audit result must show, without a doubt, as to whether </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1650"><!----></a>1.  an unqualified audit report was issued,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1651"><!----></a>2.  a qualified audit report was issued,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1652"><!----></a>3.  an adverse audit report was issued as a consequence of objections,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1653"><!----></a>4.  an adverse audit report was issued because the statutory auditor was not in a position to issue an audit opinion.</p><p><a name="p1654"><!----></a>The audit result is to be assessed, as a rule, in a comprehensible and problem-oriented manner, having due regard to the circumstance that the legal representatives are responsible for the financial statements. Risks jeopardising the future viability of the share capital company or of a group undertaking are to be addressed separately. The audit report on the consolidated financial statements of the parent undertaking is not required to address risks jeopardising the future viability of a subsidiary undertaking if the subsidiary undertaking is immaterial for the accurate presentation of the group&#8217;s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss in keeping with its actual circumstances. </p><p><a name="p1655"><!----></a>(3) In an unqualified audit report (subsection (2) sentence 1 no. 1), the statutory auditor is to declare that the audit he or she has performed pursuant to section 317 has not led to any objections and that, in the assessment of the statutory auditor based on the findings in the course of the audit, the annual financial statements or consolidated financial statements drawn up by the company&#8217;s legal representatives are compliant with statutory requirements and accurately present, while observing the principles of proper accounting or other relevant financial reporting frameworks, the share capital company&#8217;s or the group&#8217;s assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss in keeping with its actual circumstances. The statutory auditor additionally may indicate circumstances that he or she specifically highlights without qualifying the audit report.</p><p><a name="p1656"><!----></a>(4) Where objections are to be raised, the statutory auditor is to qualify the declaration pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 1, (subsection (2) sentence 1 no. 2) or is to issue an adverse audit report (subsection (2) sentence 1 no. 3). The fact that the audit report is an adverse report is to be included in the report, which no longer is to be designated a &#8220;<i>Bestätigungsvermerk</i>&#8221; (report confirming compliance). The reasons for issuing a qualified or adverse audit report are to be stated; subsection (3) sentence 2 applies. A qualified audit report may be issued only if the audited financial statements present the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss essentially in keeping with the actual circumstances, taking into account the restriction made by the statutory auditor the implications of which are recognisable.</p><p><a name="p1657"><!----></a>(5) The audit report is to be issued as an adverse audit report also in those cases in which the statutory auditor is not in a position, after having exhausted all reasonable opportunities to clear up the factual circumstances, to issue an audit opinion (subsection (2) sentence 1 no. 4). Subsection (4) sentences 2 and 3 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p1658"><!----></a>(6) The scope of the assessment of the audit result also is to cover whether the management report or the consolidated management report is consistent, in the assessment by the statutory auditor, with the annual financial statements and, as the case may be, with the standalone financial statements pursuant to section 325 (2a) or with the consolidated financial statements, whether the statutory requirements governing the drawing up of the management report or consolidated management report have been complied with and whether the management report or consolidated management report accurately presents the position of the share capital company or of the group when seen overall. In this context, the matter is to be addressed of whether the opportunities and risks of the future development have been presented accurately.</p><p><a name="p1659"><!----></a>(6a) Where several auditors or audit firms were jointly appointed to serve as statutory auditor, the assessment of the audit result is to be performed uniformly, as a rule. Where, in an exceptional case, a uniform assessment is not possible, the reasons therefor are to be presented; in each case, the assessment is to be performed in a separate paragraph. Sentences 1 and 2 apply to joint appointments of</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1660"><!----></a>1.  auditors or audit firms,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1661"><!----></a>2.  certified accountants or accountancy companies, as well as</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1662"><!----></a>3.  auditors or audit firms pursuant to nos. 1 and 2</p><p><a name="p1663"><!----></a>(7) The statutory auditor is to sign the audit report or the adverse audit report, citing the location of the statutory auditor&#8217;s branch office and the date on which the audit report was signed; in the case governed by subsection (6a), all persons appointed are to sign the audit report. The audit report or the adverse audit report also is to be incorporated into the auditor&#8217;s additional report. Where the statutory auditor is an audit firm, at a minimum that auditor is to sign it who has performed the statutory audit on behalf of the audit firm. Sentence 3 applies accordingly to accountancy companies.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1664">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1664"><!----></a>Section 323<br />Responsibilities of the statutory auditor</p><p><a name="p1665"><!----></a>(1) The statutory auditor, his or her agents and the legal representatives of an audit firm assisting with the audit are under obligation to perform the audit diligently and impartially and to maintain confidentiality; notification obligations stipulated by law remain unaffected. They are not permitted to exploit without authorisation any trade secrets or business secrets of which they have become apprised in the course of their activities. Whoever breaches his or her duties, whether intentionally or negligently, will be liable to the share capital company and, if an affiliated undertaking has suffered damages, also to the affiliated undertaking, for compensation of the damages resulting therefrom. A plurality of persons will be liable as joint and several debtors.</p><p><a name="p1666"><!----></a>(2) The audit-related indemnification obligation of the persons named in subsection (1) sentence 1 is limited as follows, subject to the stipulations of sentences 2 to 4:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1667"><!----></a>1.  in the case of share capital companies that are a public-interest entity as defined in section 316a sentence 2 no. 1: to 16 million euros;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1668"><!----></a>2.  in the case of share capital companies that are a public-interest entity as defined in section 316a sentence 2 no. 2 or 3, but not as defined in section 316a sentence 2 no. 1: to 4 million euros;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1669"><!----></a>3.  in the case of share capital companies not set out in nos. 1 and 2: to 1 million 500,000 euros.</p><p><a name="p1670"><!----></a>This applies neither to persons who have acted with intent nor to the statutory auditor of a share capital company pursuant to sentence 1 no. 1 who has acted with gross negligence. In derogation from sentence 1 no. 2, the indemnification obligation of the statutory auditor of a share capital company under sentence 1 no. 2 is limited, in the case of the statutory auditor having acted with gross negligence, to 32 million euros per audit. In derogation from sentence 1 no. 3, the indemnification obligation of the statutory auditor of a share capital company under sentence 1 no. 3 is limited, in the case of the statutory auditor having acted with gross negligence, to 12 million euros per audit. The liability caps provided for by sentences 1, 3 and 4 apply also if a plurality of persons was involved in the audit or if several actions were taken obligating those taking them to provide compensation, and having no regard to whether other parties involved acted with intent or gross negligence.</p><p><a name="p1671"><!----></a>(3) If an audit firm serves as the statutory auditor, then the confidentiality obligation will be given also vis-à-vis the supervisory board and the members of the supervisory board of the audit firm.</p><p><a name="p1672"><!----></a>(4) The obligation to indemnify pursuant to these regulations may not be precluded or restricted by contract.</p><p><a name="p1673"><!----></a>(5) The notification stipulated by Article 7 paragraph (2) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 is to be addressed to the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority; if it is suspected that a criminal offence or a regulatory offence has been committed, then such notification is to be addressed also to the prosecution authority respectively competent.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1674">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1674"><!----></a>Section 324<br />Audit committee</p><p><a name="p1675"><!----></a>(1) Share capital companies that are public-interest entities (section 316a sentence 2) and that have no supervisory board or administrative body that must meet the pre-requisites set out in section 100 (5) of the Stock Corporation Act are under obligation to institute an audit committee in accordance with subsection (2), the remit of which in particular includes the tasks described in section 107 (3) sentences 2 and 3 of the Stock Corporation Act.

Section 107 (3) sentence 8, section 124 (3) sentence 2 and section 171 (1) sentences 2 and 3 of the Stock Corporation Act apply accordingly.

In disclosing annual financial statements, standalone financial statements pursuant to section 325 (2a) or consolidated financial statements, it is to be indicated, if applicable, that the disclosure is not being made concurrently with all of the other documents to be disclosed pursuant to section 325.</p><p><a name="p1746"><!----></a>(2) Where financial statements are not rendered in the form or the format stipulated by subsection (1) in publications and reproductions that are not required by law, the articles of incorporation or the statutes, this is to be indicated in each case by a heading stating that the publication is not one corresponding to the form or format required under law. An audit report may not be attached if the financial statements are not reproduced in the form stipulated by subsection (1).

The requirements to be met by the documents designated in sentence 1 resulting from the deviating regulations are to be equivalent, as a rule, to the requirements resulting for share capital companies (section 267 (3)) under the provisions of Division 1 and of Subdivisions 1 and 2 of Division 2 as well as under the regulations applicable to the line of business. Requirements extending beyond applicable law may be made only insofar as they are based on legal acts of the Council of the European Union. The statutory instrument pursuant to sentence 1 may also permit deviations from the form of accounts pursuant to section 266 (1) sentence 1.

Where no annual financial statements or consolidated financial statements are available for the relevant financial year, the annual financial statements or consolidated financial statements for the immediately preceding financial year will be taken as the basis; where no such financial statements are available, either, the aggregate turnover may be determined by way of an estimate.</p><p><a name="p1867"><!----></a>(1c) Insofar as the Federal Office of Justice is entitled to exercise discretion in determining the amount of the coercive fine, it is also to take into account any violations the affected person has committed earlier.</p><p><a name="p1868"><!----></a>(1d) The Federal Office of Justice will notify the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority without undue delay of any coercive fine that is imposed pursuant to subsection (1) on a share capital company within the meaning of section 264d or on a member of its representative bodies.

The proceedings for the imposition of coercive fines are proceedings serving the administration of justice. Auditors and certified accountants, tax advisors, agents in tax matters, persons and associations within the meaning of section 3 no. 4 of the Tax Consultancy Act (<i>Steuerberatungsgesetz</i>) as well as companies within the meaning of section 3 nos. 2 and 3 of the Tax Consultancy Act, who are acting through persons within the meaning of section 3 no. 1 of the Tax Consultancy Act, are also authorised to represent the parties involved.</p><p><a name="p1870"><!----></a>(2a) The files, including the case files, pertaining to compulsory enforcement are maintained electronically. Section 110c of the Act on Regulatory Offences applies accordingly to the electronic maintenance of files and to electronic communications; however, sentence 1 of that stipulation of the law</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1871"><!----></a>1.  does not apply, read in conjunction with sentence 2 of that provision and with section 32b of the Code of Criminal Procedure (<i>Strafprozessordnung</i>), to</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p1872"><!----></a>a)  a warning that a coercive fine may be imposed pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 1,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p1873"><!----></a>b)  the decision as to costs pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 2, and</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p1874"><!----></a>c)  the issuance of interim orders;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1875"><!----></a>2.  does not apply, read in conjunction with sections 32d and 32e (3) sentences 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to the overall proceedings, and furthermore </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1876"><!----></a>3.  does not apply, nor do its sentences 2 and 3 apply, to the collection pursuant to the Act on the Recovery of Payments Owed to the Judiciary (<i>Justizbeitreibungsgesetz</i>).</p><p><a name="p1877"><!----></a>Sentence 2 applies accordingly also to orders within the meaning of subsections (3) and (4) that may be issued using automated means.</p><p><a name="p1878"><!----></a>(3) The parties involved designated in subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2 are to be instructed, with a warning being issued that non-compliance will entail a coercive fine in a specified amount, to comply with their statutory obligation within a period of six weeks following receipt of the warning, or to justify their failure to comply with it by filing an opposition against the order. Together with the warning issued to the parties involved regarding the imposition of a coercive fine, the costs of the proceedings are to be imposed on them. The opposition may be restricted such that solely objections against the decision as to costs may be raised. Lodging an opposition against the warning as to the coercive fine and against the decision as to costs will have no suspensive effect. Where the opposition results in the proceedings being discontinued, the decision as to costs pursuant to sentence 2 concurrently is to be set aside.</p><p><a name="p1879"><!----></a>(4) If the parties involved fail to comply with the statutory duty no later than six weeks after having received the warning, or have not justified their failure to do so by means of lodging an opposition, then the coercive fine is to be imposed and, concurrently, the earlier order is to be repeated, with a warning being issued that a new coercive fine may be imposed. Where the parties involved have complied with their statutory duty only after expiry of the six-week deadline, the Federal Office of Justice is to reduce the coercive fine as follows: </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1880"><!----></a>1.  to an amount of 500 euros if the parties involved have availed themselves of the rights enjoyed by a micro share capital company pursuant to section 326 (2);</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1881"><!----></a>2.  to an amount of 1,000 euros if a small share capital company within the meaning of section 267 (1) is concerned;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1882"><!----></a>3.  to an amount of 2,500 euros if a warning has been issued regarding a higher coercive fine and the pre-requisites set out in nos. 1 and 2 have not been met, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1883"><!----></a>4.  in each case to a lower amount if the parties involved only narrowly have missed the six-week deadline.</p><p><a name="p1884"><!----></a>In performing such a reduction, only those circumstances are to be taken into account that have occurred prior to the decision taken by the Federal Office of Justice.</p><p><a name="p1885"><!----></a>(5) Where the parties involved were prevented, through no fault of their own, to lodge the opposition within the six-week period stipulated by subsection (4) or to comply with their statutory duty, the Federal Office of Justice is to grant, upon a corresponding request being filed, the restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i>. Any culpable act by a representative is attributable to the person represented. In the event of instructions on available legal remedies having been omitted or having been erroneous, no fault will be considered to have existed. The request for restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> is to be filed in writing with the Federal Office of Justice within two weeks of the impediment having ceased to exist. The facts serving as the reasons for the request are to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Federal Office of Justice at the time the request is made or in the proceedings regarding the request. The action that it was failed to take is to be taken subsequently, no later than six weeks after the impediment has ceased to exist. Where, in the course of one year following expiry of the six-week period pursuant to subsection (4), neither a request for restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> has been made nor the action that it was failed to take has been taken, a restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> no longer can be granted. The restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> is unappealable. Where the parties involved have not requested the restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> or where the refusal of the request for restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> has become finally binding, the parties involved no longer can invoke, by their complaint, their having been prevented through no fault of their own from lodging their opposition within the six-week period or to comply with their statutory obligation.</p><p><a name="p1886"><!----></a>(5a) (repealed)</p><p><a name="p1887"><!----></a>(6) Where no indications are available to the Federal Office of Justice in proceedings pursuant to subsections (1) to (5) as concerns the allocation of a company to a size category within the meaning of section 267 (1) to (3) or of section 267a, it may instruct the parties involved designated in subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2 to state the balance sheet total, after deducting a deficit reported under assets (section 268 (3)), the turnover (section 277 (1)) and the number of employees (average for the year) (section 267 (5)) for the relevant financial year and for those financial years required to perform such an allocation to a size category. Where the information pursuant to sentence 1 is not provided, the operative assumption for the further proceedings will be that the eased requirements of sections 326 and 327 cannot be claimed. Sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly to the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated management report, with the proviso that section 293 takes the place of sections 267, 326 and 327.</p><p><a name="p1888"><!----></a>(7) By way of providing for the details of the electronic maintenance of files and of electronic communications pursuant to subsection (2a) in the version applicable from 1 January 2018 onwards, the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection may determine the following by statutory instrument not requiring the approval by the Bundesrat:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1889"><!----></a>1.  allow those files to continue to be maintained in paper form that had already been created in paper form prior to the introduction of the electronic maintenance of files,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1890"><!----></a>2.  determine the organisational and technical framework conditions, the latter in keeping with the state of the art, for the electronic maintenance of files, including the requirements of data protection, data security and accessibility that are to be complied with, </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1891"><!----></a>3.  determine in detail the standards applying to the transmission of electronic files between the Federal Office of Justice and another authority or a court,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1892"><!----></a>4.  establish the standards applying to the inspection of electronic files,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1893"><!----></a>5.  introduce electronic form sheets and </p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p1894"><!----></a>a)  determine that the information included in the forms is to be transmitted, either in its entirety or in part, in structured, machine-readable form,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p1895"><!----></a>b)  specify a communications platform on which the forms are to be made available on the Internet to allow them to be used</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p1896"><!----></a>c)  determine that an identification of the party using the form may be made, in derogation from subsection (2a) read in conjunction with section 110c of the Act on Regulatory Offences and section 32a (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure by using the electronic proof of identity pursuant to section 18 of the Act on Identity Cards (<i>Personalausweisgesetz</i>), section 12 of the Act on the eID Card (<i>eID-Karte-Gesetz</i>) or section 78 (5) of the Residence Act (<i>Aufenthaltsgesetz</i>);</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1897"><!----></a>6.  stipulate requirements as to form and further details for the automated issuance of decisions,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1898"><!----></a>7.  allow electronic documents to be submitted, in derogation from subsection (2a) read in conjunction with section 110c of the Act on Regulatory Offences and section 32a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, only from 1 January of the year 2019 or 2020 onwards, and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1899"><!----></a>8.  allow the files to continue to be maintained in the electronic form used thus far, up until a certain point in time prior to 1 January 2026.</p><p><a name="p1900"><!----></a>The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection may transfer to the Federal Office of Justice the powers set out in sentence 1, by statutory instrument not requiring the approval by the Bundesrat.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1901">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1901"><!----></a>Section 335a<br />Complaint against the imposition of a coercive fine; complaint on points of law; power to issue statutory instruments</p><p><a name="p1902"><!----></a>(1) Unless otherwise provided for in sentence 2 or in the subsections below, a complaint may be lodged in accordance with the provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-contentious Jurisdiction against the decision by which the coercive fine is imposed or by which the opposition is rejected or the request for restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> is refused, and also may be lodged against the decision pursuant to section 335 (3) sentence 5. The complaint will have suspensive effect if its subject matter is the imposition of a fine.</p><p><a name="p1903"><!----></a>(2) The complaint is to be lodged within a period of two weeks; the regional court having jurisdiction at the seat of the Federal Office of Justice decides on the complaint. In order to avoid any significant backlogs of proceedings or in order to balance out an excessive case load, the <i>Land</i> government of that <i>Land</i> in which the Federal Office of Justice maintains its seat is authorised to transfer by statutory instrument to some other regional court or to further regional courts the power to take the decision on the appellate remedies pursuant to sentence 1. The <i>Land</i> government may transfer this power to the <i>Land</i> department of justice. Where a commercial division is instituted at the regional court, this division takes the stead of the civil division. Where the civil division takes the decision on the complaint, sections 348 and 348a of the Code of Civil Procedure apply accordingly; the chairperson rules on a complaint pending with the commercial division. The regional court may determine at its equitably exercised discretion that the treasury is to reimburse the parties involved, either fully or in part, for the out-of-court costs necessary in order to bring the appropriate action. Sentence 6 applies accordingly where the Federal Office of Justice grants the relief sought by the complaint. Section 91 (1) sentence 2 and sections 103 to 107 of the Code of Civil Procedure apply accordingly. Section 335 (2) sentence 3 applies.</p><p><a name="p1904"><!----></a>(3) A complaint on points of law may be lodged against the ruling handed down on the complaint, provided the regional court has admitted it. Unless otherwise provided for in this subsection, the provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-contentious Jurisdiction apply accordingly to the complaint on points of law. The higher regional court having jurisdiction for the seat of the regional court decides on the complaint on points of law. The Federal Office of Justice likewise is entitled to file a complaint on points of law. In proceedings before the higher regional court, the parties involved must be represented by a lawyer; this does not apply to the Federal Office of Justice.

Moreover, the transferor is to state in the notes the book value of the assets transferred under the repurchase agreement. The transferee is not permitted to show the assets transferred to the transferee under the repurchase agreement in the balance sheet; he or she is to show on the balance sheet the amount paid for the transfer as a receivable from the transferor.

The amount of the contingency provisions formed in this way may not permissibly exceed four per cent of the aggregate value of the assets designated in sentence 1, as computed from their valuation pursuant to section 253 (1) sentence 1 and (4).

Section 319 (2) and (3) applies accordingly to the legal representatives of the audit association and to all persons employed by the audit association who have the ability to influence the result of the audit; section 319 (3) sentence 1 no. 2 does not apply to members of the supervisory body of the audit association provided it is assured that the statutory auditor can perform the audit independently of any instructions issued by the supervisory body.

In particular where they issue auditor&#8217;s additional reports, they are to conduct themselves impartially. Persons who are not auditors are not permitted to issue instructions to them regarding their audit activity. The number of the auditor&#8217;s active in the association must be such that the auditors signing the audit report are able to perform the audit responsibly.</p><p><a name="p2022"><!----></a>(3) Where the credit institution is a savings bank, the audits stipulated by subsection (1) may be performed, in derogation from section 319 (1) sentence 1, by the audit office of a savings bank association. However, the audit may be performed by the audit office only if the head of the audit office fulfils the pre-requisites of section 319 (1) sentences 1 and 2; section 319 (2), (3) and (5), as well as Article 5 paragraphs (1), (4) subparagraph 1 and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 apply accordingly to all persons employed by the savings bank association who have the ability to influence the result of the audit. Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 does not apply to the audit offices. Moreover, it must be ensured that the statutory auditor is able to perform the audit independently of instructions from the bodies of the savings bank association. Unless otherwise provided for by <i>Land</i> law, section 319 (1) sentences 3 and 4 apply with the proviso that the audit office must have available an excerpt relating to its registration pursuant to section 40a of the Act on the Profession of Auditors; where it performs the audit pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 for the first time, it will have such excerpt available no later than six weeks after the audit has commenced.</p><p><a name="p2023"><!----></a>(4) Where the credit institution is a savings bank, Article 4 paragraph (3) subparagraph 2 as well as Articles 16, 17 and 19 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 do not apply.

Article 4 paragraph (2) and (3) subparagraph 1 as well as Article 10 paragraph (2) (g) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 do not apply to the audit offices.</p><p><a name="p2024"><!----></a>(5) Credit institutions that are public-interest entities as defined in section 316a sentence 2 no. 1 or 2 and that have no supervisory board or administrative body that must meet the pre-requisites set out in section 100 (5) of the Stock Corporation Act are to apply section 324 even if they are not operated in the legal form of a share capital company or of a commercial partnership within the meaning of section 264a (1). This applies to savings banks within the meaning of subsection (3) as well as to other credit institutions under public law governed by <i>Land</i> law only insofar as <i>Land</i> law does not provide otherwise.

For instance, the carrier may unload the goods and store them, entrust them to a third party for storage for the account of the person having the right of disposal under sections 418 or 446, or return them; if the carrier entrusts the goods to a third party, then the carrier will be liable only for exercising due diligence in choosing the third party. The carrier may also have the goods sold in accordance with section 373 subsections (2) to (4) if they are perishable or if their condition warrants such a measure, or if the costs that would otherwise be incurred are out of proportion to the value of the goods.
