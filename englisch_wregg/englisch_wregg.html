In the event the threshold values set out in Section 106 of the Competition Act are reached, a sector contracting entity pursuant to Section 100 (1) no. 1 of the Competition Act or a concession grantor pursuant to Section 101 (1) nos. 1 and 2 of the Competition Act is obligated to consult the Competition Register prior to awarding a contract on whether there are any entries in the Competition Register relating to the bidder to whom they intend to award the contract. By way of derogation from sentences 1 and 2, the obligation to consult the register does not apply in cases with regard to which public procurement law provides for any exemptions from the applicability of public procurement law. By way of derogation from sentences 1 and 2, German agencies abroad are not required to consult the Competition Register. The contracting authority may refrain from consulting the register again if this authority has already received the information contained in the Competition Register relating to the relevant undertaking within the last two months.

If an undertaking has not been entered in the Competition Register, the registry authority communicates this to the contracting authority.</p><p><a name="p0075"><!----></a>(4) The information retrieved from the Competition Register may be brought to the attention of only those members of staff who are responsible for accepting information or processing the procurement procedure.</p><p><a name="p0076"><!----></a>(5) The contracting authority decides on its own responsibility and in accordance with the provisions under procurement law on the exclusion of an undertaking from participating in the procurement procedure.

Entries regarding fining decisions pursuant to Section 2 (2) are deleted at the latest after the expiry of three years from the day on which the fining decision was issued. Apart from that, entries are deleted at the latest after the expiry of three years from the day on which the decision became incontestable. In the event there are several entries due to the same misconduct, all entries concerning an undertaking are to be deleted if the deletion requirements are met with regard to one entry and the periods for deletion are the same; in the event of differing periods for deletion, the longer period is decisive. The provisions of Section 4 (2) sentence 2 and Section 8 (1) sentence 3 remain unaffected.</p><p><a name="p0081"><!----></a>(2) If an entry in the competition register has been deleted pursuant to subsection (1) or Section 8, the criminal or administrative offence which led to the entry may no longer be used in procurement procedures to the disadvantage of the undertaking concerned. The contracting authority is not bound by the registry authority&#8217;s rejection of a request for the deletion of an entry pursuant to Section 8 (1).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0082">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0082"><!----></a>Section 8<br />Premature deletion of entry from the Competition Register due to self-cleaning; fees and expenses</p><p><a name="p0083"><!----></a>(1) If an undertaking has been entered in the Competition Register, it may submit an application to the registry authority for the deletion of the entry from the Competition Register prior to the expiry of the period for deletion set out in Section 7(1) due to self-cleaning. The application is admissible if the undertaking demonstrates a legitimate interest in the premature deletion in a satisfactory way. The entry is to be deleted if the undertaking has proven to the registry authority that for the purposes of the procurement procedure it has implemented self-cleaning measures in accordance with Section 123 (4) sentence 2 of the Competition Act in the case of Section 2 (1) no. 1 c and d, and in accordance with Section 125 of the Competition Act in all other cases.</p><p><a name="p0084"><!----></a>(2) After the application has been filed, the registry authority examines the facts of its own motion. In doing so, it may limit itself to the facts presented by the applicant or to facts of which it can be reasonably expected to be aware. The applicant may be required</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0085"><!----></a>1.  to submit the decision issued by the criminal court or the fining decision,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0086"><!----></a>2.  to provide expert opinions or other documents suitable for evaluating the self-cleaning measures.</p><p><a name="p0087"><!----></a>Sections 57 and 59 to 59b of the Competition Act apply accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0088"><!----></a>(3) In preparation for the decision regarding the application, the registry authority may request the prosecuting authority that has communicated the data or the authority competent for the prosecution of administrative offences to transmit information which according to the assessment of the registry authority may be necessary for the evaluation of the application. The requested authority provides such information.</p><p><a name="p0089"><!----></a>(4) The registry authority evaluates the self-cleaning measures adopted by the undertaking, taking into account the gravity and special circumstances of the criminal offence or misconduct. If the authority considers the self-cleaning measures adopted by the undertaking to be insufficient, it requests additional information from the undertaking or rejects the application. If the registry authority rejects the application, it justifies its decision to the undertaking. The decision regarding the application for premature deletion of an entry is to be noted in the Competition Register. The registry authority transmits the decision regarding the application for deletion and other documents to the contracting authority upon its request.</p><p><a name="p0090"><!----></a>(5) The registry authority adopts guidelines regarding the application of (1) to (4).</p><p><a name="p0091"><!----></a>(6) In order to cover the administrative costs incurred by the registry authority, applications for the premature deletion of entries from the Competition Register due to self-cleaning are subject to fees and the reimbursement of expenses. Section 62 of the Competition Act and any statutory instruments based on this section are to be applied accordingly; the charging framework is determined based on Section 62 (2) sentence 2 no. 2 of the Competition Act.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0092">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0092"><!----></a>Section 9<br />Electronic data transmission</p><p><a name="p0093"><!----></a>(1) Any communication between the registry authority and the prosecuting authorities, the authorities competent for the prosecution of administrative offences, the contracting authorities, the undertakings and the bodies maintaining an official list that meets the requirements provided for in Article 64 of Directive 2014/24/EU generally takes place in electronic form.</p><p><a name="p0094"><!----></a>(2) Data may be transmitted to contracting authorities by way of an automated on-demand process that enables the transfer of personal data.
