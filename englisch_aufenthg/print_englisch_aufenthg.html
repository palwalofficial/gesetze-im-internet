As a general rule, if the foreigner is not entitled to a temporary residence permit, extension of the temporary residence permit is to be refused in the case of repeated and gross breach of the obligations referred to in sentence 1. If the foreigner is entitled to a temporary residence permit solely on the basis of this Act, extension may be refused unless the foreigner furnishes evidence that he or she has achieved integration into the community and society by other means. In deciding on this matter, due consideration is to be given to the duration of lawful stay, the foreigner&#8217;s legitimate ties to the federal territory and consequences of terminating residence for the foreigner&#8217;s dependants who are lawfully resident in the federal territory. If a foreigner was or is obliged to attend an integration course pursuant to section 44a (1), sentence 1, the temporary residence permit is to be extended for at most one year, as a general rule, if the foreigner has not successfully completed the integration course or has not yet furnished evidence that that he or she has achieved integration into the community and society by other means.</p><p><a name="p0123"><!----></a>(4) Subsection (3) is not to be applied to the extension of a temporary residence permit granted pursuant to section 25 (1), (2) or (3).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0124">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0124"><!----></a>Section 9<br />Permanent settlement permit</p><p><a name="p0125"><!----></a>(1) The permanent settlement permit (<i>Niederlassungserlaubnis</i>) is a residence title which is not limited in time.

In all other cases, the ban on entry and residence is to be issued, as a general rule, together with the deportation warning, the condition precedent being the deportation or removal, or at the latest at the time of deportation or removal. The length of the ban on entry and residence is to be set ex officio. The clock begins to run when the foreigner leaves the country or is refused entry. The length of the ban may be subject to conditions to prevent a threat to public safety and order, in particular requiring the foreigner to provide proof that he or she is not subject to prosecution or is not using illegal drugs. If the condition is not met before the ban expires, the ban is automatically extended at the time it would expire under sentence 5.</p><p><a name="p0199"><!----></a>(3) A discretionary decision is taken regarding the length of the time limit of the entry and residence ban. It may not exceed five years, except in cases covered by subsections (5) to (5b).</p><p><a name="p0200"><!----></a>(4) The ban on entry and residence may be revoked or shortened in order to uphold the legitimate interests of the foreigner, or if it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was imposed. As a general rule, the ban on entry and residence is to be revoked if the conditions for issuing a residence title pursuant to Chapter 2 Division 5 are met. When deciding whether the time limit of a residence and entry ban is to be shortened or whether the ban issued together with an expulsion order is to be revoked altogether, it is to be taken into account whether the foreigner met the obligation to leave the country within the period set for departure, unless the foreigner was prevented through no fault of his or her own from leaving or the period allowed for departure has been exceeded by an insignificant amount of time. The time limit of the entry and residence ban may be extended on the grounds of public safety and order. Subsection (3) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0201"><!----></a>(5) As a general rule, the length of the entry and residence ban is not to exceed 10 years if the foreigner was expelled on the ground of a criminal conviction or if the foreigner poses a serious threat to public safety and order. In these cases, subsection (4) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0202"><!----></a>(5a) As a general rule, the time limit of the entry and residence ban is to be 20 years if the foreigner was expelled on the ground of a crime against peace, of a war crime or a crime against humanity or to avert a terrorist threat or a threat to the security of the Federal Republic of Germany or a terrorist threat. In these cases, subsection (4) sentences 4 and 5 applies accordingly. As a general rule, reducing the length of the entry and residence ban or revoking it altogether is prohibited. The supreme <i>Land</i> authority may permit exceptions to this rule in individual cases.</p><p><a name="p0203"><!----></a>(5b) If the foreigner is deported from the federal territory on the basis of a deportation order under section 58a, a permanent entry and residence ban is to be issued as a general rule. In the cases covered by subsection (5a) or where the foreigner has been expelled on the ground of an interest in expulsion under section 54 (1) no. 1, 2 or 2a, a permanent entry and residence ban may be issued in the individual case. Subsection (5a) sentences 3 and 4 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0204"><!----></a>(5c) The authority which issues the expulsion order, the deportation warning or the deportation order pursuant to section 58a is also responsible for issuing the associated entry and residence ban and determining its length for the first time.</p><p><a name="p0205"><!----></a>(6) A ban on entry and residence may be issued for foreigners who have not fulfilled the obligation to leave the country within the period allowed for departure, unless they were prevented from leaving through no fault of their own or have exceeded the period allowed for departure by an insignificant amount of time. Subsection (1) sentence 2, subsection (2) sentences 3 to 6, subsection (3) sentence 1 and subsection (4) sentences 1, 2 and 4 apply accordingly. The ban on entry and residence is to be limited in time when it is ordered in accordance with sentence 1. As a general rule, the first time a ban on entry and residence is ordered in accordance with sentence 1, its length is not to exceed one year. In all other cases, its length is not to exceed three years, as a general rule. No ban on entry and residence is ordered where there are grounds for temporarily suspending deportation pursuant to section 60a for which the foreigner was not responsible.</p><p><a name="p0206"><!----></a>(7) The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees may issue a ban on entry and residence for a foreigner</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0207"><!----></a>1.  whose asylum application was rejected as manifestly unfounded under section 29a (1) of the Asylum Act, who was not granted subsidiary protection, for whom the existence of the conditions for issuing a deportation ban under section 60 (5) or (7) was not established and who does not possess a residence title or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0208"><!----></a>2.  whose application under section 71 or section 71a of the Asylum Act repeatedly did not lead to a follow-up asylum procedure.</p><p><a name="p0209"><!----></a>The ban on entry and residence takes effect when the decision on the application for asylum assumes legal validity. Subsection (1) sentences 3 and 4, subsection (2) sentences 3 to 6, subsection (3) sentence 1 and subsection (4) sentences 1, 2 and 4 apply accordingly. The ban on entry and residence is to be limited in time when it is ordered in accordance with sentence 1. As a general rule, the first time a ban on entry and residence is ordered in accordance with sentence 1, its length is not to exceed one year. In all other cases, its length is not to exceed three years, as a general rule. The competent foreigners authority decides on revoking, extending or shortening of the ban.</p><p><a name="p0210"><!----></a>(8) Before the ban on entry and residence expires, the foreigner may, by way of exception, be allowed to enter the federal territory for a brief period if the foreigner&#8217;s presence is required for compelling reasons or if denying permission would constitute undue hardship. The supreme <i>Land</i> authority is responsible for deciding in the cases covered covered by subsections (5a) and (5b).</p><p><a name="p0211"><!----></a>(9) If a foreigner enters the federal territory in contravention of a ban on entry and residence, the running of a fixed period is suspended during the foreigner&#8217;s stay in in the federal territory. The period may be extended in such cases, at the most, however, by the length of the original ban. The foreigner is to be informed of this possibility when the length of the ban is set for the first time. Subsections (3) and (4) sentence 1 apply accordingly to a ban extended in accordance with sentence 2.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0212">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0212"><!----></a>Section 12<br />Area of application; ancillary provisions</p><p><a name="p0213"><!----></a>(1) The residence title is issued for the federal territory.

Conditions, in particular geographic restrictions, may also be imposed subsequently on visas and temporary residence permits. In particular, geographic restrictions may be imposed on temporary residence permits in cases where there is public interest in expelling the foreigner pursuant to section 54 (1) nos. 1 or 1a and where restrictions are necessary to remove the foreigner from an environment in which he or she is more likely to commit serious crimes.</p><p><a name="p0215"><!----></a>(3) A foreigner must immediately leave any part of the federal territory in which he or she may be staying without the permission of the foreigners authority in breach of a geographic restriction.</p><p><a name="p0216"><!----></a>(4) The residence of a foreigner who does not require a residence title may be made subject to time limits, geographic restrictions, conditions and requirements.</p><p><a name="p0217"><!----></a>(5) The foreigners authority may permit the foreigner to leave the geographic area to which he or she is restricted on the basis of this Act. This permission is to be granted if an urgent public interest applies, if it is necessary for compelling reasons or if denying permission would constitute undue hardship. The foreigner needs no permission for appointments at authorities or court hearings where his or her personal appearance is necessary.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0218">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0218"><!----></a>Section 12a<br />Residence rule</p><p><a name="p0219"><!----></a>(1) In order to promote their lasting integration into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany, foreigners who have been granted asylum status, refugee status within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Asylum Act, subsidiary protection status within the meaning of section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act or who have been granted a temporary residence permit for the first time pursuant to section 22, 23, section 24 (1) or section 25 (3) are required to take up their habitual residence (place of residence) in that <i>Land</i> to which they have been allocated for the purposes of their asylum procedure or in the context of their admission process or in accordance with section 24 (3) for a period of three years from the time such status or temporary residence was granted. Sentence 1 does not apply where a foreigner, the foreigner&#8217;s spouse, registered civil partner or a minor unmarried child who is related to the foreigner and lives in a family household with the foreigner takes up or has taken up employment of at least 15 hours per week with full social security coverage, on account of which that person has an income amounting to at least the average monthly needs for individual persons pursuant to sections 20 and 22 of Book Two of the Social Code, or that person takes up or has taken up vocational training or is pursuing studies or is in a training relationship, or takes up, has taken up or has completed an integration course as referred to in section 43, a vocational language course as referred to in section 45a, a training measure lasting at least three months which leads to the recognition of occupational qualifications, or a further training measure as referred to in sections 81 and 82 of Book Three of the Social Code, if the course or training measure cannot be completed or continued in the place of residence stipulated in sentence 1 without delay. The period referred to in sentence 1 may be extended by the period during which the foreigner fails to meet the obligations stipulated in sentence 1.

They are not entitled to be allocated to a specific <i>Land</i> or a specific town or location. Allocation to the <i>Länder</i> is carried out by a central allocation agency determined by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community. Unless another formula for allocation has been agreed among the <i>Länder</i>, the formula for the allocation of asylum applicants applies. Each <i>Land</i> appoints up to seven authorities to request allocation by the agency appointed in accordance with sentence 3 and to admit the allocated foreigners. If the foreigner furnishes evidence prior to allocation that a household community exists between spouses or parents and their minor children or that other compelling reasons exist which conflict with allocation to a certain place, this is given due consideration in the allocation process.</p><p><a name="p0272"><!----></a>(2) The foreigners authorities may require foreigners to present themselves to the authority requesting allocation.

Otherwise, the reception centre designated by the central allocation agency on the basis of the allocation quota pursuant to section 45 of the Asylum Act and the available accommodation capacities is obliged to admit the foreigners concerned. Section 46 (4) and (5) of the Asylum Act applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0274"><!----></a>(4) In the cases covered by subsection (3) sentence 3 the authority which has requested allocation pursuant to subsection (3) orders the foreigner to report to the reception centre designated as a result of the allocation process; in the cases covered by subsection (3) sentence 2 it may issue such an order. The foreigners authority forwards the result of the interview to the authority requesting allocation, which notifies the central allocation agency of the number of foreigners, stating the countries of origin and the results of the interview. Spouses and parents and their minor unmarried children are registered and allocated as a group. The foreigner must stay at this reception centre until re-allocated to another location within the <i>Land</i>, but only until deportation has been suspended or a residence title has been issued; sections 12 and 61 (1) remain unaffected. The <i>Land</i> governments are authorised to regulate allocation within the <i>Land</i> by statutory instrument, unless allocation is regulated by <i>Land</i> law on the basis of this Act; section 50 (4) of the Asylum Act applies accordingly. The <i>Land</i> governments may delegate the said authorisation to other bodies of the <i>Land</i>. Orders pursuant to sentence 1 are not contestable. Any legal actions have no suspensive effect. Sentences 7 and 8 apply accordingly, if an allocation order is issued on the basis of a <i>Land</i> law or a statutory instrument pursuant to sentence 5.</p><p><a name="p0275"><!----></a>(5) Following allocation, the competent authorities may permit the foreigner to take up residence in another <i>Land</i>.

During residence as referred to in sentence 1, no temporary residence permit may be granted for employment under section 19c (1) in conjunction with a provision of the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners for temporary employment. Section 9 does not apply unless the foreigner possessed a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 18a or 18b before the temporary residence permit pursuant to sentence 1 was granted. The residence purpose of quality in-company vocational training as referred to in sentence 1 also comprises German language courses preparing participants for vocational training, in particular job-related German language training in line with the Ordinance on German Language Training (<i>Deutschsprachförderverordnung</i>).</p><p><a name="p0282"><!----></a>(2) As a general rule, foreigners are to be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose of school-based vocational training, if such training leads to a state-recognised vocational qualification as determined by federal or state provisions, unless the qualification pathway is primarily tailored to nationals of one specific country. Bi- or multilateral agreements of the <i>Länder</i> with public bodies in another country governing attendance of domestic schools by foreign school pupils remain unaffected. A temporary residence permit for the purpose of school attendance may only be issued on the basis of such agreements if the supreme <i>Land</i> authority responsible for residence law has endorsed the agreement.

Measures to prepare for studies are</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0287"><!----></a>1.  attending a language course to prepare for studies, if the foreigner has been accepted for full-time studies and the acceptance depends on the foreigner attending the preparatory language course, and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0288"><!----></a>2.  attending a preparatory or comparable course prior to studying, if the foreigner can prove that he or she has been accepted for the preparatory or comparable course.</p><p><a name="p0289"><!----></a>Proof of knowledge of the language needed for the specific course of studies is only required if the foreigner&#8217;s knowledge of the language has not been tested in the decision on acceptance and language acquisition is not the aim of the preparatory measures for the course of study.</p><p><a name="p0290"><!----></a>(2) The period of validity when the temporary residence permit for study purposes is granted for the first time and for each subsequent extension is, as a rule, two years and is not generally to be less than one year. The period of validity is at least two years if the foreigner takes part in Union or multilateral programmes that comprise mobility measures or if the foreigner is covered by an agreement between two or more higher education institutions. Where the course of study takes less than two years, the temporary residence permit is granted only for the duration of the course of study. The temporary residence permit is extended if the purpose of residence has not yet been achieved and is achievable within a reasonable period of time. The host educational institution may be consulted to find out whether the purpose of residence is still achievable.</p><p><a name="p0291"><!----></a>(3) In accordance with the following sentences, the temporary residence permit only entitles the holder to employment of up to a total of 140 working days per year (working day account). Student jobs are not counted. Part-time employment will be counted as follows in the way most favourable for the foreigner:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0292"><!----></a>1.  every day on which the working time does not exceed four hours may be counted for the working day account as one-half working day, otherwise as a full working day, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0293"><!----></a>2.  employment may be counted for the working day account per calendar week</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0294"><!----></a>a)  during the semester, if a maximum of 20 hours per calendar week are worked, and</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0295"><!----></a>b)  other than during the semester</p><p><a name="p0296"><!----></a>independent of how the working time is distributed, as two and one-half working days.

Where, in individual cases, the institution providing basic income support for jobseekers decides otherwise, it is to notify the foreigners authority accordingly, which will then revoke the obligation. The obligation is to be revoked where it is unreasonable to expect a foreigner to attend a part-time course in addition to pursuing an economic activity.

Section 60 (2), (3), (5) and (7) remains unaffected.</p><p><a name="p1324"><!----></a>(2) The obligation to leave the federal territory is enforceable if the foreigner</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1325"><!----></a>1.  has entered the federal territory unlawfully,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1326"><!----></a>2.  has not yet applied for the necessary residence title for the first time or for its extension or has submitted an application, but the foreigner&#8217;s residence is not deemed to be permitted pursuant to section 81 (3) or the residence title is not deemed to remain valid pursuant to section 81 (4), or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1327"><!----></a>3.  is required to leave the federal territory by virtue of a return decision reached by another member state of the European Union in accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 2001/40/EC of 28 May 2001 on the mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third country nationals (OJ L 149, p. 34), if the decision concerned is recognised by the competent authority.</p><p><a name="p1328"><!----></a>In all other cases, the obligation to leave the federal territory becomes enforceable only when the denial of the residence title or another administrative act requiring the foreigner to leave pursuant to section 50 (1) takes effect.</p><p><a name="p1329"><!----></a>(3) Supervision of departure is necessary in particular if the foreigner</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1330"><!----></a>1.  is, by judicial order, in detention or another form of public custody,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1331"><!----></a>2.  has failed to leave the federal territory within the period allowed for departure,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1332"><!----></a>3.  has been expelled on the ground of a particularly serious public interest in expulsion as referred to in section 54 in conjunction with section 53,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1333"><!----></a>4.  is destitute,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1334"><!----></a>5.  does not possess a passport or passport substitute,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1335"><!----></a>6.  has furnished the foreigners authority with incorrect information or refused to furnish information with intent to deceive or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1336"><!----></a>7.  has indicated that he or she will not meet the obligation to leave the federal territory.</p><p><a name="p1337"><!----></a>(4) The authority carrying out the deportation is authorised to take the foreigner to the airport or to a border crossing point for the purpose of deportation and to detain the foreigner temporarily for this purpose. Such detention is to be limited to the extent necessary to carry out the deportation.</p><p><a name="p1338"><!----></a>(5) The authority carrying out the deportation may, to the extent necessary to carry out the deportation, enter the home of the foreigner to be deported for the purpose of apprehending the foreigner if there are facts indicating that the foreigner is present. In forms of communal accommodation, sentence 1 also applies to the home of other persons and to areas used in common by all residents. The home comprises residential and secondary premises, working and business premises, production sites and other fenced-in property.</p><p><a name="p1339"><!----></a>(6) The authority carrying out the deportation may, to the extent necessary to carry out the deportation, search the home of the foreigner to be deported for the purpose of apprehending the foreigner. Searches of other persons&#8217; homes are permitted only for the purpose of apprehending the foreigner to be deported if there are facts indicating that the foreigner is present on the premises to be searched. Subsection (5) sentence 3 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p1340"><!----></a>(7) At night, the home may be entered or searched only if there are facts indicating that it would otherwise be impossible to apprehend the foreigner for the purpose of deportation. Organising the deportation does not constitute a fact as referred to in sentence 1 unless it involves conditions which cannot be influenced by the authority carrying out the deportation.</p><p><a name="p1341"><!----></a>(8) Searches under subsection (6) may only be ordered by a judge or, in case of danger in delay, by the authority carrying out the deportation. After entering the home in accordance with subsection (5), the fact that the foreigner was not found there cannot be used to justify the assumption of danger in delay.</p><p><a name="p1342"><!----></a>(9) The occupant of the premises to be searched may be present during the search. If the occupant is absent, the occupant&#8217;s representative or adult family member, another member of the household or a neighbour is to be present, if possible. In the cases of subsection (6) sentence 2, the occupant or representative in the occupant&#8217;s absence is to be informed in advance of the purpose of the search. A record of the search is to be made. This record must include the responsible police station, the reason for the search, the time and place of the search and, if no court order was issued, the facts justifying the assumption of danger in delay. The home&#8217;s occupant or the occupant&#8217;s representative is to be given a copy of the record upon request. If, under the special circumstances of the case, it is impossible to make a record or to provide a copy of the record, or if doing so would jeopardise the purpose of the search, the home&#8217;s occupant or the occupant&#8217;s representative is to be given written confirmation of the search including the responsible police station and the time and place of the search.</p><p><a name="p1343"><!----></a>(9a) The ordinary courts of law are responsible for judicial orders pursuant to subsection (8). The provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-Contentious Jurisdiction apply to the procedure accordingly.

Section 59 (2) and (3) applies accordingly. Assessment in this context is carried out by the authority deciding on the deportation order; this authority is not bound by findings reached in this connection in other proceedings.</p><p><a name="p1349"><!----></a>(4) After the deportation order has been announced, foreigners are to be given an opportunity to contact a legal adviser of their choice without delay, unless they have secured the services of a lawyer beforehand; foreigners are to be informed of this entitlement, of the legal consequences of the deportation order and the available legal remedies. An application for temporary relief pursuant to the Code of Administrative Court Procedure (<i>Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung</i>) must be filed within seven days of announcement of the deportation order. Deportation may not be enforced until the period referred to in sentence 2 has expired and, if an application for temporary relief is filed in time, until the court has decided on said application.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1350">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1350"><!----></a>Section 59<br />Deportation warning</p><p><a name="p1351"><!----></a>(1) The foreigner is to be served with a deportation warning specifying a reasonable period of between seven and 30 days for voluntary departure, provided no deportation ban applies and deportation would not be contrary to the well-being of a child, to family ties or to the foreigner&#8217;s health. By way of exception, a shorter period may be set or such a period may be waived altogether if, in individual cases, it is vital to safeguard overriding public interests, in particular where</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1352"><!----></a>1.  a well-founded suspicion exists that the foreigner intends to evade deportation,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1353"><!----></a>2.  the foreigner poses a serious threat to public safety or law and order.</p><p><a name="p1354"><!----></a>Under the conditions in sentence 2, warning the foreigner of intention to deport may also be waived if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1355"><!----></a>1.  the residence title pursuant to section 51 (1) nos. 3 to 5 has expired or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1356"><!----></a>2.  the foreigner has already been informed in accordance with the requirements of section 77 that he or she is required to leave the federal territory.</p><p><a name="p1357"><!----></a>Taking account of the particular circumstances of each case, the period allowed for departure may be extended as appropriate or a longer period may be set. Section 60a (2) remains unaffected. If the obligation to leave or the deportation warning ceases to be enforceable, the period allowed for departure is to be interrupted and begins to run again when the obligation or notice becomes enforceable once more. It is not necessary to set a new time limit. When the period allowed for voluntary departure expires, the foreigner is not to be informed of the date of the deportation.</p><p><a name="p1358"><!----></a>(2) As a rule, the deportation warning is to specify the state to which the foreigner is to be deported and is to inform the foreigner that he or she may also be deported to another state which he or she is permitted to enter or which is obliged to admit him or her. Entities and territorial authorities as referred to in Annexes I and II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1806 have the same status as states.</p><p><a name="p1359"><!----></a>(3) Deportation bans and the grounds listed in subsection (1) sentence 1 for the temporary suspension of deportation are no obstacle to issuing a deportation warning if the foreigner is required to leave the country because of or following a criminal conviction or is the subject of a pending extradition procedure. The state to which the foreigner may not be deported is to be specified in the deportation warning. If the administrative court establishes the existence of a deportation ban, the lawfulness of the deportation warning otherwise remains unaffected.</p><p><a name="p1360"><!----></a>(4) Once the deportation warning is no longer subject to appeal, the foreigners authority is not to take into account in further decisions any circumstances constituting an obstacle to deportation to the state specified in the deportation warning and which occurred before the deportation warning was no longer subject to appeal; any other circumstances cited by the foreigner constituting an obstacle to deportation, or to deportation to the specified state, may be ignored. The provisions enabling the foreigner to assert the validity of the circumstances referred to in sentence 1 through a court of law by means of a legal action or the temporary relief procedure pursuant to the Code of Administrative Court Procedure remain unaffected.</p><p><a name="p1361"><!----></a>(5) It is not necessary to set a deadline in cases covered by section 58 (3) no. 1; the foreigner will be deported directly from detention or public custody.</p><p><a name="p1362"><!----></a>(6) The foreigner is to be issued a certificate confirming that a period for departure has been set pursuant to subsection (1).</p><p><a name="p1363"><!----></a>(7) If the foreigners authority has concrete grounds to suspect that the foreigner was the victim of a criminal offence as referred to in section 25 (4a) sentence 1 or section 25 (4b) sentence 1, in derogation from subsection (1) sentence 1, the foreigners authority sets a period for departure which will allow the foreigner sufficient time to decide whether he or she is prepared to testify in accordance with section 25 (4a) sentence 2 no. 3 or section 25 (4b) sentence 2 no. 2. A period of at least three months will be allowed for departure. The foreigners authority may refrain from setting a period for departure pursuant to sentence 1 or may annul or reduce the period for departure, if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1364"><!----></a>1.  the foreigner&#8217;s stay is detrimental to public safety and order or other substantial interests of the Federal Republic of Germany or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1365"><!----></a>2.  the foreigner has voluntarily re-established contact with the persons referred to in section 25 (4a) sentence 2 no. 2 after being duly informed pursuant to sentence 4.</p><p><a name="p1366"><!----></a>The foreigners authority or a body authorised by it informs the foreigner of the applicable arrangements, programmes and measures for victims of criminal offences referred to in section 25 (4a) sentence 1.</p><p><a name="p1367"><!----></a>(8) Before being deported, foreigners who were employed without the entitlement to pursue an economic activity required under section 4a (5) are to be informed of their rights pursuant to Article 6 (2) and Article 13 of Directive 2009/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 providing for minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals (OJ L 168, 30.6.2009, p. 24).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1368">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1368"><!----></a>Section 60<br />Deportation bans</p><p><a name="p1369"><!----></a>(1) In application of the Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees (Federal Law Gazette 1953 II, p. 559), foreigners may not be deported to a state in which their life or liberty is threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a certain social group or political convictions. This also applies to persons who are entitled to asylum and to foreigners who have been incontestably granted refugee status or who have the legal status of foreign refugees on other grounds in the federal territory or who have been granted foreign refugee status outside of the federal territory in accordance with the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. If a foreigner invokes the ban on deportation pursuant to this subsection, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is to establish in an asylum procedure whether the conditions stated in sentence 1 apply, and the foreigner is to be granted refugee status, except in cases covered by sentence 2. The decision by the Federal Office may only be contestable subject to the provisions of the Asylum Act.</p><p><a name="p1370"><!----></a>(2) Foreigners may not be deported to a state where they face serious harm as referred to in section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act. Subsection (1) sentences 3 and 4 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p1371"><!----></a>(3) If a foreigner may not be deported to a state in which he or she is wanted for a criminal offence and there is a danger that the death penalty will be imposed or enforced, the provisions on extradition apply accordingly.</p><p><a name="p1372"><!----></a>(4) If a formal request for extradition or a request for arrest combined with a notification of intent to file a request for extradition has been received from another state, the foreigner may be deported to this state prior to the decision on extradition only with the approval of the authority responsible for approving extradition under section 74 of the Act on International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (<i>Gesetz über die internationale Rechtshilfe in Strafsachen</i>).</p><p><a name="p1373"><!----></a>(5) A foreigner may not be deported if deportation is prohibited under the terms of the Convention of 4 November 1950 for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Federal Law Gazette 1952 II, p. 685).</p><p><a name="p1374"><!----></a>(6) The general risk that a foreigner may face prosecution and punishment in another state and, unless otherwise stipulated in subsections (2) to (5), the concrete threat of lawful punishment under the legal system of another state does not preclude deportation.</p><p><a name="p1375"><!----></a>(7) As a rule, foreigners are not to be deported to another state in which they face a substantial concrete threat to life and limb or liberty. Section 60a (2c) sentences 2 and 3 applies accordingly. A substantial concrete threat for health reasons only exists in the case of life-threatening or serious illness which would significantly worsen if the foreigner is deported. It is not necessary for medical care in the state of destination to be equivalent to medical care in the Federal Republic of Germany. Sufficient medical care generally also exists where it is guaranteed only in part of the state of destination. Threats as referred to in sentence 1 to which the population or the segment of the population to which the foreigner belongs are generally exposed are to be taken into account in orders pursuant to section 60a (1) sentence 1.</p><p><a name="p1376"><!----></a>(8) Subsection (1) does not apply if, for serious reasons, the foreigner is to be regarded as a threat to the security of the Federal Republic of Germany or constitutes a threat to the general public because he or she has been incontestably sentenced to a prison term of at least three years for a crime or a particularly serious offence. The same applies if the foreigner meets the conditions stipulated in section 3 (2) of the Asylum Act. Application of subsection (1) may be waived if the foreigner represents a threat to the general public because he or she has been incontestably sentenced to a prison term or a term of youth custody of at least one year for one or more intentionally committed offences against life, physical integrity, sexual self-determination or property or for resisting enforcement officers if the criminal offence was committed using violence, using a threat of harm to life or limb, or with guile, or if it constitutes an offence pursuant to section 177 of the Criminal Code.</p><p><a name="p1377"><!----></a>(9) In the cases covered by subsection (8), a foreigner who has filed an application for asylum may, in derogation from the provisions of the Asylum Act, be notified of intention to deport and duly deported. Subsections (2) to (7) remain unaffected.</p><p><a name="p1378"><!----></a>(10) If a foreigner to whom the conditions in subsection (1) apply is to be deported, a deportation warning must be sent and a reasonable period must be allowed for departure. Those states to which the foreigner may not be deported are to be specified in the deportation warning.</p><p><a name="p1379"><!----></a>(11) (repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1380">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1380"><!----></a>Section 60a<br />Temporary suspension of deportation (<i>Duldung</i>)</p><p><a name="p1381"><!----></a>(1) For reasons of international law or on humanitarian grounds or to safeguard the political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany, the supreme <i>Land</i> authority may order the deportation of foreigners from specific states or of categories of foreigners defined by any other means to be suspended in general or with regard to deportation to specific states for a maximum of three months. Section 23 (1) applies to a period in excess of six months.</p><p><a name="p1382"><!----></a>(2) The deportation of a foreigner is to be suspended for as long as deportation is impossible in fact or in law and no temporary residence permit is granted. The deportation of a foreigner is also to be suspended if the public prosecutor&#8217;s office or the criminal court considers his or her temporary presence in the federal territory to be appropriate in connection with criminal proceedings relating to a criminal offence, because it would be more difficult to investigate the facts of the case without information from the foreigner. Foreigners may be granted a temporary suspension of deportation if their continued presence in the federal territory is necessary on urgent humanitarian or personal grounds or due to substantial public interests. Where the recording of the acknowledgement of paternity or the mother&#8217;s consent to carry out a procedure pursuant to section 85a is suspended, the deportation of the foreigner acknowledging paternity, of the foreign mother or the foreign child is to be suspended until the procedure pursuant to section 85a has been concluded by means of an enforceable decision.</p><p><a name="p1383"><!----></a>(2a) The deportation of a foreigner is to be suspended for one week where his or her removal or deportation has failed, custody awaiting deportation is not ordered and the Federal Republic of Germany is obliged to readmit the foreigner by virtue of a legal provision, in particular Article 6 (1) of Council Directive 2003/110/EC of 25 November 2003 on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air (OJ L 321, 6.12.2003, p. 26). Suspension pursuant to sentence 1 may not be extended. The foreigner is to be allowed to enter the federal territory.</p><p><a name="p1384"><!----></a>(2b) For as long as a foreigner who holds a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25a (1) is a minor, the deportation of his or her parents or of one parent having the sole right of care and custody as well as of those minor children who live as a family unit with the parents or the parent having the sole right of care and custody is, as a rule, to be suspended.</p><p><a name="p1385"><!----></a>(2c) It is assumed that the deportation is not precluded on health grounds. The foreigner must provide credible evidence of an illness which might interfere with deportation by submitting a qualified medical certificate. As a rule, this medical certificate is to document in particular the factual circumstances on which the professional assessment was based, the method of establishing the facts, the specialist medical assessment of the illness (diagnosis), the severity of the illness, its Latin name or classification according to ICD 10 and the medical assessment of the probable consequences of the situation resulting from the illness. Medications needed to treat the illness must be listed along with their active ingredients under the names used in international practice.</p><p><a name="p1386"><!----></a>(2d) The foreigner is required to submit the medical certificate referred to in subsection (2c) immediately to the competent authority. If the foreigner fails to submit such a medical certificate immediately, the competent authority need not take into account the foreigner&#8217;s submissions regarding his or her illness, unless the foreigner was prevented, through no fault of his or her own, from obtaining such a certificate or there is other factual evidence for the existence of a life-threatening or serious illness which would be significantly worsened by deportation. If the foreigner submits a certificate and the authority then orders a medical examination, the authority is entitled not to take the reported illness into account if the foreigner does not comply with the order without sufficient reason. The foreigner is to be informed of the obligations and the legal consequences of any breach of these obligations pursuant to this subsection.</p><p><a name="p1387"><!----></a>(3) Suspension of deportation does not affect the foreigner&#8217;s obligation to leave the federal territory.</p><p><a name="p1388"><!----></a>(4) The foreigner is to be issued with a certificate confirming the suspension of deportation.</p><p><a name="p1389"><!----></a>(5) The suspension of deportation lapses when the foreigner leaves the federal territory. The suspension is revoked when the circumstances preventing deportation cease to apply. The foreigner is deported without delay when the suspension lapses, without any renewed deportation warning specifying a deadline, unless the suspension is renewed.</p><p><a name="p1390"><!----></a>(5a) If the deportation of a foreigner who has children under age 12 is suspended for more than a year, the foreigner is to be notified of the planned deportation at least one month in advance when the suspension is revoked as referred to in subsection (5) sentence 2; the notification is to be repeated if the suspension has been renewed for more than a year. Sentence 1 does not apply if the foreigner brought about the obstacle to deportation by intentionally furnishing false information or by own deceit concerning his or her identity or nationality or if he or she fails to meet reasonable requirements to cooperate in removing obstacles to departure.</p><p><a name="p1391"><!----></a>(5b) As a general rule, foreigners whose deportation has been suspended are to be permitted to engage in economic activity if the Federal Employment Agency has granted its approval or a statutory instrument stipulates that the employment concerned is permitted without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency. Sentence 1 does not apply if at the time of application for permission to pursue an economic activity concrete measures to terminate residence are imminent which are close enough to the termination of residence in terms of content and timing; such concrete measures to terminate residence are imminent if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1392"><!----></a>1.  a medical examination to determine the ability to travel has been carried out,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1393"><!----></a>2.  the foreigner has applied for government funds to assist with voluntary departure,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1394"><!----></a>3.  the process of booking transport for the deportation has been initiated,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1395"><!----></a>4.  similar concrete preparations to deport the foreigner have been initiated, unless it is foreseeable from the outset that such measures will be unsuccessful, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1396"><!----></a>5.  the procedure for determining the member state responsible in accordance with Article 20 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 has been initiated.</p><p><a name="p1397"><!----></a>(6) In all other cases, foreigners whose deportation has been suspended may not be permitted to pursue an economic activity if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1398"><!----></a>1.  they entered the country to obtain benefits under the Act on Benefits for Asylum Applicants,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1399"><!----></a>2.  measures to terminate their stay cannot be carried out for reasons for which they are responsible, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1400"><!----></a>3.  they are nationals of a safe country of origin according to section 29a of the Asylum Act and an asylum application which they filed after 31 August 2015 has been denied or withdrawn, unless the application was withdrawn based on advising from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees as referred to in section 24 (1) of the Asylum Act, or no asylum application was filed.</p><p><a name="p1401"><!----></a>Foreigners are in particular responsible for reasons referred to in sentence 1 no. 2 if they themselves have brought about the obstacle to deportation by their own deceit concerning their identity or nationality or by furnishing false information. Sentence 1 no. 3 does not apply to unaccompanied foreign minors whose asylum applications have been withdrawn or for whom no application for asylum was made if the application was withdrawn or no application was made in the best interests of the child.

The foreigners authority is the competent authority as referred to in section 156 of the Criminal Code.</p><p><a name="p1413"><!----></a>(4) If the foreigner has not undertaken the reasonable efforts referred to in subsection (2) sentence 1 and subsection (3) sentence 1, he or she may undertake them at any later time.

As a rule, public bodies are to notify the competent foreigners authority immediately if, in discharging their duties, they become aware of special integration needs within the meaning of a statutory instrument enacted under section 43 (4). In addition to the cases regulated in sentence 1, the bodies responsible for benefits under Book Two or Book Twelve of the Social Code are required to notify the foreigners authority if a foreigner holding a temporary residence permit under Chapter 2 Divisions 3 or 4 applies for such benefits for him- or herself or for family members.

The data are to be anonymised as soon as the research purpose allows. The research organisation to which the data were transmitted may only process the data to carry out the research project. The data are to be protected against unauthorised disclosure to third parties. The research organisation must ensure that the use of the personal data is physically and organisationally separate from the performance of administrative tasks or business purposes for which these data could also be significant.
