For a first-time provider, the amount as defined in sentence 1 is determined for the first twelve months on the basis of the sum that the provider is likely to have to pay for the accounting of the respective tolled road network on average each month in the first twelve months taking into account how many contracts it has and the average toll per contract estimated in its business plan.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0083">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0083"><!----></a>Section 10<br />Accreditation of providers</p><p><a name="p0084"><!----></a>(1) A provider who wants to offer toll-related services within a tolled road network needs to be accredited by the competent Federal or federal state authority.</p><p><a name="p0085"><!----></a>(2) The Federal Government and the federal states, upon application, accredit any provider that wishes to offer toll-related services in their area of jurisdiction if the provider complies with the respective territorial requirements of section 9 (1) and the domain statements within the meaning of section 22 (2) and (3). A provider is accredited for a tolled road network by means of a contract under public law concluded between the authority responsible for collecting the toll on the relevant road network and the provider.</p><p><a name="p0086"><!----></a>(3) Whether a provider meets the criteria for accreditation is verified based on a contract under public law to regulate the necessary rights and obligations of the parties for the test (test agreement) between the authority responsible for collecting the toll on the tolled road network and the provider.</p><p><a name="p0087"><!----></a>(4) If the competent authority and a registered provider cannot agree on the conclusion of the contract in accordance with subsection (2) sentence 2 or subsection (3) or on individual provisions of the contract, either party to the negotiations may call upon the Conciliation Body in accordance with 30 (1).</p><p><a name="p0088"><!----></a>(5) The Federal Government and the federal states are to publish in the Federal Gazette, in non-personal form, all providers that they have accredited in compliance with subsection (2).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0089">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0089"><!----></a>Section 10a<br />Remuneration</p><p><a name="p0090"><!----></a>(1) The Federal or federal state authority responsible for collecting the toll pays a remuneration to each accredited provider.

The level of remuneration of providers may differ from that of the operator where</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0092"><!----></a>1.  the operator receives a remuneration for costs incurred in fulfilling requirements and obligations that do not apply to providers; and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0093"><!----></a>2.  the competent authority reduces the remuneration of providers by fixed charges for the costs it incurs in providing, operating and maintaining a system that meets the requirements of the toll service on its tolled road network, including the costs of accreditation, as long as the costs of providing, operating and maintaining a system that meets the requirements of the toll service on its tolled road network are not included in the toll.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0094">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0094"><!----></a>Section 11<br />Limited accreditation</p><p><a name="p0095"><!----></a>(1) For the purpose of verifying compliance with the requirements as laid down in section 10 (2) sentence 1 under effective operation conditions (pilot operation), the authorities responsible at Federal or federal state level for toll collection may accredit a provider with whom a test agreement in accordance with section 10 (3) has been concluded to provide toll-related services in their area of jurisdiction to a limited extent until the pilot operation has been successfully completed (limited accreditation). Limited accreditation may be granted</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0096"><!----></a>1.  in the form of a contract under public law between the authority responsible for collecting the toll and the provider; or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0097"><!----></a>2.  by means of an administrative act of the authority responsible for collecting the toll.</p><p><a name="p0098"><!----></a>(2) The limited accreditation is equivalent in effect to an accreditation within the meaning of section 10 (1). In the cases referred to in subsection (1) sentence 2 no. 1, it may be subject to regulations, and in the cases referred to in subsection (1), sentence 2 no. 2, it may be subject to conditions and constraints that limit the scope of the accreditation for the purpose of the test in accordance with subsection (1). In particular, the competent authority may limit the number of users of the provider accredited to use the tolled road network in question during the pilot phase. In all other respects, section 36 of the Administrative Procedure Act remains unaffected.</p><p><a name="p0099"><!----></a>(3) All obligations of accredited providers arising or resulting from this Act apply also to providers with limited accreditation, unless otherwise provided for in this Act or in the rules and regulations adopted on the basis of this Act.</p><p><a name="p0100"><!----></a>(4) The Federal Government and the federal states are to publish in the Federal Gazette, in non-personal form, all providers that they have accredited to a limited extent in compliance with subsection (1).</p><p><a name="p0101"><!----></a>(5) Section 10 (4) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0102"><!----></a>(6) The authority responsible for collecting the toll may collect charges and expenses for the limited accreditation within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 2 no. 2. Section 8 sentence 2 applies accordingly in the case of limited accreditation by a Federal authority.

Within 24 months of the conclusion of the first accreditation agreement in a Member State of the European Union or in another Contracting Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, providers must conclude accreditation agreements for all tolled road networks belonging to the toll service, provided the competent authority for collecting the toll on the respective tolled road network complies with the requirements of Article 6 (3) of Directive (EU) 2019/520. If the coverage of tolled road networks within the meaning of sentence 1 is no longer given, the provider must restore full coverage without delay.</p><p><a name="p0105"><!----></a>(2) Providers registered with the Federal Logistics and Mobility Office must publish information on the tolled road networks they cover and any changes to them immediately after registration.

Providers registered with the Federal Logistics and Mobility Office must also submit by October 31 of each calendar year a declaration to the Federal Logistics and Mobility Office stating the tolled road networks on which they provide toll-related services. The Federal Logistics and Mobility Office checks at least once a year whether the providers registered with it still meet the requirements as defined in sentences 1 and 2.
