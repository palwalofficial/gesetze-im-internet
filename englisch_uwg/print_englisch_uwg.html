An activity has no commercial purpose for the benefit of another entrepreneur if the person or entity engaged in it does not obtain payment or a similar consideration, nor a promise thereof, for the activity undertaken by the other entrepreneur.

Further claims to compensation remain unaffected.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0213">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0213"><!----></a>Section 13a<br />Contractual penalty</p><p><a name="p0214"><!----></a>(1) When determining an appropriate contractual penalty as per section 13 (1), consideration is to be given to the following:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0215"><!----></a>1.  the nature, extent and consequences of the infringement,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0216"><!----></a>2.  the culpability of the infringement and, in the case of culpable infringement, the severity of the guilt,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0217"><!----></a>3.  the size, market strength and competitiveness of the entity issued with a written warning notice, and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0218"><!----></a>4.  the economic interest of the entity issued with a written warning notice in past and future infringements.</p><p><a name="p0219"><!----></a>(2) The agreement of a contractual penalty in accordance with subsection (1) is ruled out for claimants pursuant to section 8 (3) no. 1 in the case of a first written warning notice in the case of infringements under section 13 (4) if the entity issued with the written warning notice generally employs fewer than 100 members of staff.</p><p><a name="p0220"><!----></a>(3) Contractual penalties may not exceed 1,000 euros if, in the light of the nature, extent and consequences of the infringement, the infringement interferes with the interests of consumers, competitors and other market participants to only an insignificant degree and if the entity issued with the written warning notice generally employs fewer than 100 members of staff.</p><p><a name="p0221"><!----></a>(4) If the entity issued with the written warning notice, upon the request of the entity issuing the written warning notice, promises to pay an appropriate contractual penalty, then it is liable only to pay an appropriate contractual penalty.</p><p><a name="p0222"><!----></a>(5) Where agreement has only been reached on payment of a contractual penalty but it has not yet been quantified, the entity issued with the written warning notice may, in the case of disagreement as to the amount of the penalty, apply to a conciliation board pursuant to section 15 even without the consent of the entity issuing the written warning notice.

In the event of referral by a qualified entity entitled to assert a claim to cease and desist in accordance with section 8 (3) no. 3, an equal number of entrepreneurs and consumers are to act as assessors, otherwise at least two expert entrepreneurs. The chairperson is, as a rule, to be experienced in the field of competition law. For each disputed case the persons sitting as assessors are to be chosen by the chairperson from a list which is to be compiled annually for the calendar year. Appointment is, as a rule, to be effected with the agreement of the parties. Sections 41 to 43 and section 44 (2) to (4) of the Code of Civil Procedure apply accordingly to the exclusion and rejection of members of the conciliation board. The regional court (chamber for commercial matters or, in the event of there being no such chamber, the civil chamber) with jurisdiction in respect of the seat of the conciliation board gives a decision on a motion of challenge.</p><p><a name="p0234"><!----></a>(3) Referral may be made to a conciliation board in civil law disputes where a claim is asserted by virtue of this Act, provided that the opposing party consents thereto.

It may make the parties a written settlement proposal, giving its reasons for the settlement proposed. The settlement proposal and the reasons therefor may only be published with the consent of the parties.</p><p><a name="p0238"><!----></a>(7) If a settlement is reached, it must be recorded in a specific document bearing the date upon which it was reached and it must be signed by the members of the conciliation board who took part in the negotiation as well as by the parties. There may be recourse to compulsory execution in respect of a settlement concluded before the conciliation board; section 797a of the Code of Civil Procedure applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0239"><!----></a>(8) The conciliation board may refuse to initiate the negotiation of a settlement if, at the outset, it considers the asserted claim to be ill-founded or considers itself as not having jurisdiction.</p><p><a name="p0240"><!----></a>(9) The statute of limitations is interrupted by referral to a conciliation board as though a court action had been brought.

In proceedings concerning an application for the granting of a provisional injunction, such order is only admissible with the consent of the opposing party. Subsection (8) does not apply. Where proceedings are pending before the conciliation board, a court action is not admissible if it is brought only by the party opposing the application after referral to the conciliation board for a declaration to the effect that the asserted claim does not exist.</p><p><a name="p0242"><!----></a>(11) The Land governments are authorised to issue, by statutory instrument, the provisions required to implement the aforementioned provisions and regulate proceedings before the conciliation boards, in particular regarding supervision of the conciliation boards, regarding their composition, including adequate participation of entrepreneurs who are not members of the chambers of industry and commerce (section 2 (2) to (6) of the Act for Temporary Regulation of the Law Governing the Chambers of Industry and Commerce (Gesetz zur vorläufigen Regelung des Rechts der Industrie- und Handelskammern), in the consolidated version published in Federal Law Gazette III, Index No. 701-1), and regarding the enforcement of administrative fines, as well as for making stipulations on the charging of fees by the conciliation board.
