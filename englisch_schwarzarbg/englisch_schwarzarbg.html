If data extraction would involve a disproportionate amount of time and effort and there are no overriding legitimate interests of the person concerned, employers and contractors as well as users of temporary work may, as part of an inspection pursuant to section 2 (1) nos 4, 5, 6 and 9, provide data storage devices that can be processed by automated means or lists containing the data required without having previously extracted the relevant data. In this case, the customs authorities must separate the data and delete any data that does not need to be submitted pursuant to sentence 1. If the transmitted data is not needed for the purposes of investigating criminal or administrative offences, investigating tax-relevant circumstances or setting social security contributions or benefits, the data storage devices or lists must, at the request of the employer or contractor, be returned or the data deleted without delay following the conclusion of the inspections pursuant to section 2 (1).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0128">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0128"><!----></a>Section 5a<br />Unauthorised offering of and creating demand for labour</p><p><a name="p0129"><!----></a>(1) It is forbidden for a person to offer their labour as a day labourer in a public space from a group in such a way that enables undeclared work or unlawful employment.

The customs authorities on the one hand, and the law enforcement authorities and police authorities on the other hand, are obliged to share with each other any information required for the prevention and prosecution of criminal and administrative offences related to one of the matters for inspection specified in section 2 (1), including personal data. Information, including personal data, may in addition be shared with law enforcement authorities and police authorities if there are actual indications that this information is required for the prevention and prosecution of criminal or administrative offences that are not related to one of the matters for inspection specified in section 2 (1).</p><p><a name="p0133"><!----></a>(2) In order to perform their tasks pursuant to section 2 (1) and for the purpose of prosecuting criminal or administrative offences, the customs authorities may automatically access the Federal Employment Agency&#8217;s data systems on issued EU work permits and authorisations to take up employment, on foreign nationals employed under works and services contract quotas, as well as on recipients of benefits pursuant to Book III of the Social Code; law enforcement authorities are only entitled to carry out automated access if this is necessary for the prosecution of criminal or administrative offences. Section 79 (2) to (4) of Book X of the Social Code applies accordingly. The customs authorities may automatically access data from the databases of the pension providers, insofar as this is required for the prevention and prosecution of criminal or administrative offences; section 150 (5) sentence 1 of Book VI of the Social Code remains unaffected. The customs authorities may automatically access data from the following databases insofar as this is required for the preparation and carrying out of inspections pursuant to section 2 (1) sentence 1 nos 2 and 3 and for the prevention and prosecution of criminal and administrative offences that are associated with this inspection task: </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0134"><!----></a>1.  the databases of the joint entities and the approved local authority providers under Book II of the Social Code and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0135"><!----></a>2.  the databases of the Federal Employment Agency in its capacity as the entity responsible for the centrally managed IT procedures under section 50 (3) of Book II of the Social Code regarding recipients of benefits under Book II of the Social Code.</p><p><a name="p0136"><!----></a>The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is authorised to specify, by issuing ordinances with the consent of the Bundesrat, the conditions for the access procedure pursuant to sentence 4 and how to carry out the access procedure.</p><p><a name="p0137"><!----></a>(3) The customs authorities may access the data held by the Federal Central Tax Office pursuant to section 5 (1) no 13 of the Fiscal Administration Act, insofar as this is required for performing its inspection tasks pursuant to section 2 (1) or for directly connected administrative fine proceedings and criminal proceedings. An on-demand automatic procedure must be set up for accessing data subject to tax secrecy pursuant to section 30 of the Fiscal Code. The customs authority that accesses the data is responsible for the permissibility of the individual access instance. The body accessing the data may process the data pursuant to sentence 1 for the purpose for which it accessed the data. If there is a risk that data access pursuant to the first sentence will jeopardise the purpose of an investigation as referred to in section 30 (2) no 1 (b) of the Fiscal Code, the revenue authority responsible for this investigation or the competent public prosecutor&#8217;s office may order that no data access is allowed to take place. Section 478 (1) sentences 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure apply if the data relates to investigations that resulted in criminal proceedings. A statutory instrument issued by the Federal Ministry of Finance requiring the consent of the Bundesrat stipulates further details, in particular regarding the on-demand automatic procedure including the logging and regarding the proof of the technical and organisational measures necessary on the basis of Articles 24, 25 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation; OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1; OJ L 314, 22.11.2016, p. 72; OJ L 127, 23.5.2018, p. 2) or on the basis of section 64 of the Federal Data Protection Act.</p><p><a name="p0138"><!----></a>(4) The customs authorities must inform the respective competent authorities if, when fulfilling their tasks pursuant to this Act, they find indications of violations of </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0139"><!----></a>1.  this Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0140"><!----></a>2.  the Act on Temporary Agency Work,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0141"><!----></a>3.  the provisions of Books IV and VII of the Social Code on the payment of contributions,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0142"><!----></a>4.  tax laws,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0143"><!----></a>5.  the Residence Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0144"><!----></a>6.  the duty to cooperate pursuant to section 60 (1) sentence 1 nos 1 and 2 of Book I of the Social Code or the reporting obligation pursuant to section 8a of the Asylum Seekers Benefit Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0145"><!----></a>7.  the Federal Child Benefit Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0146"><!----></a>8.  the Trade and Crafts Code or the Trade Regulation Code,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0147"><!----></a>9.  the Road Haulage Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0148"><!----></a>10.  the Passenger Transport Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0149"><!----></a>11.  other criminal laws,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0150"><!----></a>12.  the Posted Workers Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0151"><!----></a>13.  the Minimum Wage Act,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0152"><!----></a>14.  the occupational health and safety laws, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0153"><!----></a>15.  the Land procurement laws and Land laws on compliance with collective labour agreements.</p><p><a name="p0154"><!----></a>Documents seized pursuant to section 5 (3) sentence 1 must be sent to the authority responsible for foreign nationals without delay.</p><p><a name="p0155"><!----></a>(5) If there are indications that a document seized pursuant to section 5 (3) sentence 1 is forged or has been tampered with, it must be sent to the competent police authority.</p><p><a name="p0156"><!----></a>(6) Sections 8a to 8e of the Administrative Procedures Act in conjunction with Article 6 (1), (2) and (4)&#8211;(9), Article 7 and Article 21 of Directive 2014/67/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the enforcement of Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and amending Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System (&#8216;the IMI Regulation&#8217;) (OJ L 159, 28.5.2014, p. 11) apply to the cooperation between the customs authorities and authorities of other European Union member states and authorities of other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area in accordance with section 20 (2) of the Posted Workers Act, section 18 (2) of the Minimum Wage Act and section 18 (6) of the Act on Temporary Agency Work.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0157">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0157"><!----></a>Section 6a<br />Sharing of personal data with European Union member states</p><p><a name="p0158"><!----></a>(1) The customs authorities may share personal data related to one of the matters for inspection specified in section 2 (1) with an authority of a European Union member state responsible for the prevention and prosecution of crimes for the purpose of preventing crimes.
