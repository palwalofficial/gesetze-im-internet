The judge at the local court hears persons pursued about their personal circumstances, in particular nationality. The judge must draw their attention to the right to avail themselves of the services of legal counsel (section 40) at any stage of the proceedings and to the fact that they are free to either make a statement or not make a statement regarding the offence of which they are accused. The judge then asks whether and, if so, for what reasons they wish to object to the warrant of arrest pending transit or to the permissibility of the transit. If a person pursued raises objections which are not manifestly unfounded or if the judge at the local court has doubts about continuing that person&#8217;s detention or about the permissibility of the transit, then the judge without delay and by expeditious means notifies the public prosecution office at the higher regional court thereof.

The foreign judgment is binding in respect of the measure of the sanction to be set; it may, however, not exceed the maximum possible sanction for the offence within the area of application of this Act.

If the offence giving rise to the other Member State&#8217;s request was not committed in that Member State&#8217;s sovereign territory and Germany&#8217;s jurisdiction is established for that offence, then the amount of the financial penalty is to be reduced to the maximum amount to be imposed under German law for a comparable offence if the sanction imposed in the other Member State exceeds this maximum amount.</p><p><a name="p0874"><!----></a>(3) If the other Member State&#8217;s decision is declared enforceable, the decision and the amount of the financial penalty to be enforced must be indicated. Reasons are to be given in the authorisation notice, which is to be served on the person concerned. The authorisation notice</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0875"><!----></a>1.  indicates that the authorisation will become final and that the financial penalty will become enforceable if no objection is raised pursuant to subsection (4),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0876"><!----></a>2.  requests the person concerned to pay the financial penalty to the Federal Treasury no later than two weeks after the notice becomes final.</p><p><a name="p0877"><!----></a>(4) The person concerned may object to the authorisation notice in writing or for the record of the authorising authority within two weeks following its service. Sections 297 to 300 and section 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on appellate remedies and sections 42 bis 47 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on times limits and restoration of the status quo ante apply accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0878"><!----></a>(5) If the objection against the authorisation of enforcement is not submitted in due time or in the prescribed form or is submitted in another manner as to render it ineffective, the authorising authority rejects it as inadmissible.

If the authorising authority does not remedy the person concerned&#8217;s objection or the person concerned applies for a court decision in accordance with section 87f (5) sentence 2, then it is for the local court with jurisdiction under subsection (2) to give a decision. The competent local court, further, gives a decision pursuant to section 87i upon application by the authorising authority. Sections 34 (1) and 107 of the Youth Courts Act and section 68 (2) of the Act on Regulatory Offences apply accordingly. The authorising authority prepares the decision.</p><p><a name="p0882"><!----></a>(2) Local jurisdiction is determined on the basis of the person concerned&#8217;s residence if that person is a natural person. If the person concerned has no residence in Germany, jurisdiction is determined on the basis of his or her habitual residence or, if that is not known, last residence. If the person concerned is a legal entity, jurisdiction falls to the court in whose district the legal entity has its seat. In the case under section 87h, the date of receipt of the objection is relevant, in the event of section 87i the date on which the court receives the application. If these places cannot be identified, jurisdiction falls to that court in whose district the person concerned&#8217;s assets are located. If the person concerned&#8217;s assets are located in the districts of various local courts, then jurisdiction lies with that local court which was first seised of the case. Section 58 (1) of the Courts Constitution Act remains unaffected.</p><p><a name="p0883"><!----></a>(3) The court sends the person concerned a copy of a German translation of the other Member State&#8217;s decision if this is necessary for the exercise of that person&#8217;s rights. Where an application as referred to in section 87i (1) is made, the person concerned is also to be served copies of the documentation referred to in section 87a and of the decision, pursuant to section 87i (2), not to assert any obstacles to authorisation. In the case under sentence 2, the person concerned is requested to respond within a period to be determined by the court.</p><p><a name="p0884"><!----></a>(4) Section 52 (1) applies accordingly to preparing the decision, with the proviso that the competent authority in the requesting Member State must also have been given the opportunity to submit additional documentation if the documentation submitted is not sufficient to be able to assess whether the authorising authority correctly exercised its discretion not to assert any obstacles to authorisation. A time limit may be set for submission of the documentation. The authorising authority enforces the decisions given by the court in accordance with sentences 1 and 2. The court may take other evidence in respect of constituent elements of the offence over and above those referred to in section 87h (3) sentence 1 nos. 1, 2 and 3. Section 30 (2) sentence 4 and (3) and section 31 (4) apply accordingly. If the person concerned is in Germany, section 30 (2) sentence 1 and section 31 (2) apply accordingly. Section 31 (1) sentence 1 applies accordingly, with the proviso that the authorising authority takes the place of the public prosecution office. The authorising authority is not obliged to participate in the court hearing; the court notifies the authorising authority if it holds such participation to be appropriate.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0885">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0885"><!----></a>Section 87h<br />Court decision following objection or person concerned&#8217;s application</p><p><a name="p0886"><!----></a>(1) It is for the local court to give a decision, by way of court order, in respect of whether an objection is admissible and well-founded.</p><p><a name="p0887"><!----></a>(2) Where the provisions on lodging an objection have not been complied with, the court dismisses the objection as inadmissible.

In the cases under sentence 2, the public prosecution office at the regional court in whose district the competent local court has its seat is responsible for enforcement in the capacity as enforcing authority.

The court decisions required under sentence 1 in the course of enforcement are given by the local court at the seat of the enforcing authority. In proceedings against juveniles and young adults, sections 82 (1), 83 (2), 84 and 85 (5) of the Youth Courts Act also apply analogously. The provisions of the Act on the Recovery of Claims of the Judicial Authorities (<i>Justizbeitreibungsgesetz</i>) apply, unless otherwise provided for under this Act.
