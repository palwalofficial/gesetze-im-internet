The representative body of the acquiring legal entity is entitled to apply for entry in the register of the merger also with the register kept at the registered seat of each of the legal entities being acquired.</p><p><a name="p0107"><!----></a>(2) In filing the application for entry in the register, the representative bodies are to declare that no action has been brought against the entry into force of a merger resolution, or that any action brought was not filed in due time or was dismissed by a ruling that has become final and conclusive, or that such action has been retracted; the representative bodies are to notify the court maintaining the register of these circumstances also after they have filed the application for entry. Where no such declaration is available, the merger may not be entered in the register unless the share owners who are entitled to bring an action declare, by a notarised declaration of waiver, that they waive bringing an action against the entry into force of the merger resolution.</p><p><a name="p0108"><!----></a>(3) It shall be equivalent to the declaration pursuant to subsection (2), first sentence, if, once an action has been brought against the entry into force of a merger resolution, the court has established by a court order, upon the petition filed by that legal entity against whose merger resolution the action is directed, that the fact of the action having been filed does not contravene the merger&#8217;s entry in the register. Unless stipulated otherwise, section 247 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG), sections 82, 83 (1) and section 84 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) as well as the regulations of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) applicable to proceedings of first instance before the regional courts shall apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to the proceedings. A court order pursuant to the first sentence shall be delivered if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0109"><!----></a>1.  the action is impermissible or manifestly unfounded, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0110"><!----></a>2.  the plaintiff has failed to provide evidence by submitting the corresponding deeds, within one (1) week of having served the petition, that he has been holding a pro-rated amount of at least EUR 1,000 since the notice convening the assembly was published, or </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0111"><!----></a>3.  the prompt entering into force of the merger appears to take precedence because the court holds, at its discretion and conviction, that the significant disadvantages for the legal entities involved in the merger and the owners of their shares as presented by the petitioner outweigh the disadvantages the respondent stands to suffer; this shall not apply if the violation of the law is particularly grave.</p><p><a name="p0112"><!----></a>In urgent cases, the court order may be delivered without a hearing for oral argument being held. The court order is to be delivered not later than three (3) months after the petition has been filed; the reasons for any delays to the decision shall be provided in a court order that is not contestable. The facts and circumstances brought before the court, by reason of which the court order pursuant to the third sentence may be delivered, are to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court. A division of the higher regional court in the judicial district of which the company has its registered seat shall rule on the petition. Transferring the matter to a judge sitting alone is ruled out; no conciliation hearing is required. The court order shall be incontestable. Should good cause have been shown for the action, then that legal entity that has obtained the court order shall be under obligation to compensate the respondent for the damages that the latter has suffered as a result of the merger having been entered in the register based on the court order; no demand may be made for compensation of the damages by way of removing the effects of entering the merger in the register kept at the registered seat of the acquiring legal entity.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0113">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0113"><!----></a>Section 17 <br />Annexes to the application for entry in the register</p><p><a name="p0114"><!----></a>(1) The following are to be attached to the application for entry in the register, as execution copies or publicly certified copies or, insofar as they need not be recorded by a notary, as the original or a copy thereof: the merger agreement, the records of the merger resolutions, the declarations of consent required by the present Act to be given by individual owners of shares, including the declarations of consent by those owners of shares who have not attended the assembly, the merger report, the audit report, or the declarations of waiver pursuant to section 8 (3), section 9 (3), section 12 (3), section 54 (1), third sentence, or section 68 (1), third sentence, as well as proof of the merger agreement, or its draft, having been forwarded in due time to the works council responsible.</p><p><a name="p0115"><!----></a>(2) Furthermore, a balance sheet (closing balance sheet) of each of the legal entities being acquired is to be attached to the application for entry in the register kept at the registered seat of each of said legal entities being acquired.
