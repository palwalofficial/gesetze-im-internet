The authorising authority is specifically entitled to request the documentation on which the conformity assessment is based. The personal data include first name, last name, address, professional qualifications, completed continued education and training courses and previous career positions. The personal data collected by the authorising authority have to be deleted as soon as they are no longer required, at the latest three years after expiry of the authorisation.

The authorising authority may only use the collected data if this is necessary to exclude persons from the conformity assessment which was the reason for consulting the certificate of conduct. Technical and organisational measures have to ensure that unauthorised persons cannot access these data. The data are to be deleted without delay if no conformity assessment is carried out following the consultation of the document. In all other cases the data are to be deleted three months after the end of such an activity at the latest.
