For information requests under sentence 1, the right to refuse testimony under sections 53 and 53a and the right to refuse to give information under section 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (<i>Strafprozessordnung</i>) apply accordingly. Upon application, compensation for responding to information requests is to be granted in accordance with the provisions of the Judicial Remuneration and Compensation Act (<i>Justizvergütungs- und -entschädigungsgesetz</i>) on the compensation of witnesses.

This also applies to reports for which, pursuant to section 4 (1), the external reporting office is not competent for follow-up. The external reporting office must promptly notify the reporting person that the report has been forwarded. If it is not possible to forward the report while ensuring that the identity of the reporting person remains confidential, section 9 (3) must be observed.</p><p><a name="p0269"><!----></a>(3) Where an external reporting office concludes that a reported breach is minor, it may close the procedure at its duty-bound discretion.</p><p><a name="p0270"><!----></a>(4) If a report concerns a matter in respect of which a procedure under this Act has already been closed, an external reporting office may close the procedure at its duty-bound discretion if the report does not contain any new facts.
