When this Annex is adjusted to reflect technical progress in a procedure pursuant to Art. 19 of the Directive, the amended version may already be applied from its entry into force. It must be applied after expiry of the specified implementation deadline.</p><p><a name="p0060"><!----></a>(3) Where a biological agent is not classified according to para. 2, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may classify it into a risk group pursuant to para. 1 after having consulted the Committee pursuant to section 19. The classifications shall be published in the Joint Ministerial Gazette. The employer shall observe such classifications.</p><p><a name="p0061"><!----></a>(4) Where a biological agent has been classified neither under para. 2 nor under para. 3, the employer intending to engage in a specific activity involving this biological agent shall classify it into one of the risk groups pursuant to para. 1. In this context, the employer shall respect the following:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0062"><!----></a>1.  Where several risk groups are to be considered for the classification, the biological agent shall be classified into the highest potential risk group;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0063"><!----></a>2.  Viruses which have already been isolated in humans shall be classified no lower than into risk group 2 unless such viruses are unlikely to cause human disease;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0064"><!----></a>3.  Strains which have been attenuated or lost known virulence genes may be classified into a lower risk group than the parental strain provided they were adequately investigated and assessed. Where the parental strain was classified into risk groups 3 or 4, a downgrading may only take place on the basis of a scientific assessment that may be undertaken by the Committee according to section 19.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0065">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0065"><!----></a>Part 2<br />Risk assessment, assignment to protection levels, documentation and record-keeping obligations</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0066">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0066"><!----></a>Section 4<br />Risk assessment</p><p><a name="p0067"><!----></a>(1) In the context of the risk assessment according to section 5 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the employer shall evaluate the risk for his/her employees resulting from the activities involving biological agents prior to the start of such activities. The risk assessment shall be performed professionally. If the employer does not have the appropriate expertise, he/she shall seek expert advice.</p><p><a name="p0068"><!----></a>(2) The employer shall immediately update the risk assessment when</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0069"><!----></a>1.  this is required because of substantial changes in working conditions or new information such as accident reports or findings from occupational medical examinations, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0070"><!----></a>2.  the verification of the functioning and effectiveness of protective measures has shown that the established protective measures are not effective.</p><p><a name="p0071"><!----></a>In all other cases, the employer shall check the risk assessment at least every two years and update it, if necessary. When the verification shows that an update of the risk assessment is not required, the employer shall duly record this in the documentation pursuant to section 7 together with the date of the verification.</p><p><a name="p0072"><!----></a>(3) For the purposes of risk assessment, the employer shall investigate the following issues in particular:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0073"><!----></a>1.  the identity, the risk group classification and the infection pathways of the biological agents, their potential sensitising or toxic effects and uptake pathways to the extent that this information can be collected,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0074"><!----></a>2.  the type of activity taking into account the operating procedures, processes and materials used including the facilities and equipment,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0075"><!----></a>3.  the type, duration and frequency of exposure of employees to the extent that this information is accessible to the employer,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0076"><!----></a>4.  the possibility of using biological agents, processes or materials that would result in no or a lower risk for the employees (substitution checks),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0077"><!----></a>5.  activity-related findings</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0078"><!----></a>a)  on stress or exposure situations including psychological stress,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0079"><!----></a>b)  on known diseases and the countermeasures to be implemented,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0080"><!----></a>c)  from preventive occupational health care.</p><p><a name="p0081"><!----></a>(4) On the basis of the information collected pursuant to para. 3, the employer shall independently assess the infection risk and the risks due to sensitising and toxic effects. These individual assessments shall be collated in an overall assessment that provides the basis for the definition and implementation of protective measures. This shall also apply when several biological agents are present or used simultaneously in one activity.</p><p><a name="p0082"><!----></a>(5) Where it is impossible to obtain the necessary information for the risk assessment such as the risk group classification for activities involving products containing biological agents, the employer shall procure such information from the manufacturer, the importer or the person responsible for marketing. Clause 1 does not apply to foodstuffs in the form of finished products intended for final consumption.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0083">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0083"><!----></a>Section 5<br />Activities with an assigned protection level</p><p><a name="p0084"><!----></a>(1) For activities in laboratories, the husbandry of laboratory animals, biotechnology and healthcare facilities, the employer shall, in addition to section 4 para. 3, determine whether the activities performed are specific or non-specific.
