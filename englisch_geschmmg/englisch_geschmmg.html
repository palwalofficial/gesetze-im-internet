Minutes are to be drawn up of the hearings and taking of evidence containing the essential course of the proceedings and the relevant statements made by the parties; sections 160a, 162 and 163 of the Code of Civil Procedure apply accordingly. </p><p><a name="p0218"><!----></a>(4) The decision is issued by way of an order. The substance of the decision may be delivered at the end of the hearing. The decision must be reasoned and a copy served on the parties ex officio; the copy need not be certified. Execution copies are only made upon the application of one of the parties and only in paper form. Section 47 (2) of the Patent Act applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0219"><!----></a>(5) The decision includes a decision on the costs of the proceedings; section 62 (2) and section 84 (2) sentence 2 of the Patent Act apply accordingly. In the cases referred to in subsection (2) sentence 2 and 3, the German Patent and Trade Mark Office decides on the costs of the proceedings upon application only; the decision on the costs may be issued by separate decision. Such application may be made as follows: </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0220"><!----></a>1.  in the case referred to in subsection (2) sentence 2, up until the expiry of one month after the decision on the determination or declaration of invalidity has become non-appealable,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0221"><!----></a>2.  in the case referred to in subsection (2) sentence 3, up until the expiry of one month following service of the decision to terminate the proceedings.</p><p><a name="p0222"><!----></a>If no decision is taken as to costs, each of the parties bears their own costs arising.</p><p><a name="p0223"><!----></a>(6) A determination as to the value in dispute is made by decision upon application. Where a decision is given on the costs, a decision on the value in dispute may be given ex officio. The decision on the value in dispute may be combined with the decision on the costs. Section 23 (3) sentence 2 and section 33 (1) of the Lawyer&#8217;s Remuneration Act (<i>Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz</i>) apply accordingly to the determination as to the value in dispute.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0224">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0224"><!----></a>Section 34b<br />Suspension</p><p><a name="p0225"><!----></a>If, during invalidity proceedings, an action is or becomes pending whose decision is dependent on the legal validity of the registered design, the court may order the suspension of the action. Suspension is to be ordered if the court regards the registered design to be invalid.

This right to cessation and desistance may also be exercised in the event of the risk of a first-time infringement.</p><p><a name="p0273"><!----></a>(2) If the infringer acts intentionally or negligently, he or she is obliged to compensate the aggrieved party for the damage caused.

The civil division decides. The provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-Contentious Jurisdiction (<i>Gesetz über das Verfahren in Familiensachen und in den Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit</i>) apply accordingly to the proceedings. The costs of the court order are borne by the aggrieved party. An appeal from the decision of the regional court is the available remedy.

However, the subject matter of the title or of the application may not be used or may only be used with restrictions in the territory to which the title or the application has been extended if unlimited use would lead to a particular disadvantage for the holder of the other title or of the other application or for persons who have been authorised to use the subject matter of the title or of the application and would be unreasonable, when taking into account all the circumstances of the case and when weighing up the justified interests of those concerned.</p><p><a name="p0376"><!----></a>(7) The effect of a registered design extended under section 1 or section 4 of the Extension Act, as amended on 31 May 2004, does not apply to any person who had lawfully begun to use the registered design in the territory in which the title did not apply up until the entry into force of the Extension Act after the day which is operative for the filing or priority date of the application and prior to 1 July 1990. Such person is authorised to use the registered design in the whole of the federal territory for the needs of their own business in their own plant or workshops or the plant or workshops of others with the limitations resulting from applying section 12 of the Patent Act accordingly, on condition that the use does not cause particular prejudice to the holder of the title or the persons who have been authorised to use the subject matter of the title and would be unreasonable when taking into account all the circumstances of the case and when weighing up the justified interests of those concerned. In the case of a product manufactured abroad, the user only has a right to continued use under sentence 1 if the use in Germany has led to a property situation which warrants protecting and whose non-recognition, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, would represent an unreasonable hardship for the user.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0377">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0377"><!----></a>Section 61<br />Typographic typefaces</p><p><a name="p0378"><!----></a>(1) Legal protection is granted under this Act to all typographic typefaces registered in accordance with Article 2 of the Typefaces Act (<i>Schriftzeichengesetz</i>) in the version applicable until midnight on 1 June 2004, unless otherwise provided under subsections (2) to (5).</p><p><a name="p0379"><!----></a>(2) The provisions on the conditions of protectability continue to apply to applications filed before midnight on 31 May 2004 in accordance with Article 2 of the Typefaces Act in the version applicable on that date.</p><p><a name="p0380"><!----></a>(3) Rights conferred by registered designs may not be exercised in respect of acts which were begun before 1 June 2004 and which the holder of the typographic typeface could not have prohibited under the provisions applicable on that date.</p><p><a name="p0381"><!----></a>(4) Until such time as the typefaces referred to in subsection (1) are registered, their protective effects are determined by the Typefaces Act in the version applicable until midnight on 31 May 2004.</p><p><a name="p0382"><!----></a>(5) In derogation from section 28 (1) sentence 1, renewal fees are payable only from the 11th year of the term of protection to maintain the term of protection for the typefaces referred to in subsection (1).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0383">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0383"><!----></a>Division 12<br />Community designs</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0384">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0384"><!----></a>Section 62<br />Forwarding of application</p><p><a name="p0385"><!----></a>Where applications for a Community design are filed with the German Patent and Trade Mark Office in accordance with Article 35 (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs (OJ L 3, 5.1.2002, p. 1), the German Patent and Trade Mark Office makes a note on the application of the date of receipt and forwards the application, without examination and without delay, to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0386">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0386"><!----></a>Section 62a<br />Application of provisions of this Act to Community designs</p><p><a name="p0387"><!----></a>Insofar as German law is applicable, the following provisions of this Act apply accordingly to the rights of the holder of a Community design protected under Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0388"><!----></a>1.  the provisions on rights to removal of the impairment (section 42 (1) sentence 1), to compensation for damage caused (section 42 (2)), to destruction, to recall and release (section 43), to information (section 46), to production and inspection (section 46a), to securing claims for damages (section 46b) and to the publication of the judgment (section 47), along with the rights under Article 89 (1) (a) to (c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0389"><!----></a>2.  the provisions on the liability of the owner of an enterprise (section 44), compensation (section 45), limitation (section 49) and on claims under other statutory provisions (section 50);</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0390"><!----></a>3.  the provisions on seizure on import or export (sections 55 to 57).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0391">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0391"><!----></a>Section 63<br />Community design litigation</p><p><a name="p0392"><!----></a>(1) The regional courts have exclusive jurisdiction as Community design courts of first instance for all actions for which the Community design courts within the meaning of Article 80 (1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 have jurisdiction (Community design litigation), irrespective of the value in dispute.</p><p><a name="p0393"><!----></a>(2) The<i> Land</i> governments are authorised to assign, by statutory instrument, Community design litigation cases for the districts of more than one Community design court to one of these courts.
