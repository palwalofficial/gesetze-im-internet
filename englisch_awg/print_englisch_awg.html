The competent court is the local court in whose district the search is to take place. The procedure is correspondingly subject to the provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-contentious Jurisdiction. The possessor of the dwelling or the business premises or production site has the right to be present during the search. If he or she is absent, a representative or an adult relative, housemate or neighbour should if possible be present. The possessor or his or her representative must be informed of the reason for the search without delay to the extent that this does not jeopardise the purpose of the measure. A written record must be made of the search. It must name the responsible agency, the reason, time and place of the search. The written record must be signed by an official carrying out the search and the possessor or the person present in his or her place. If a person refuses to sign the record, a note must be made of this. On demand, the possessor or his or her representative must be handed a copy of the record. If the making of the record or the handing over of a copy is not possible due to the special circumstances of the case, or if it would jeopardise the purpose of the search, only confirmation that the search has taken place, citing the responsible agency and the time and place of the search, is to be given in writing to the possessor or the person present in his or her place.</p><p><a name="p0161"><!----></a>(5) Subsection 2 number 5 and subsection 3 restrict the fundamental right to the inviolability of the home (Article 13 paragraph 1 of the Basic Law).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0162">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0162"><!----></a>Section 9b<br />Measures to freeze money and economic assets</p><p><a name="p0163"><!----></a>(1) The competent authority can order the freezing in order to prevent money or economic assets of certain persons or partnerships who are subject to a limitation of disposition under a directly applicable act of the European Communities or the European Union published in the Official Journal of the European Communities or the European Union which serves to implement an economic sanction adopted by the Council of the European Union in the field of Common Foreign and Security Policy from being disposed of in violation of such an act or used contrary to such an act.

The provisional order must be revoked without delay as soon as the existence of a limitation of disposition has been finally examined. If the examination shows that a limitation of disposition exists, an order under subsection 1 sentence 1 must be examined.</p><p><a name="p0165"><!----></a>(3) As soon as the freezing is revoked, the money or economic assets must be issued to the person from whom they were frozen. If it is not possible to issue them to that person, they can be issued to any other person who credibly asserts his or her entitlement.

If the nature of the physical items does not permit this, or if impounding at the competent authority does not appear appropriate, the physical items must be held or secured in another appropriate way, to the extent that the measures ordered under Section 9b appear insufficient. In the cases of sentence 2, a suitable third party can be commissioned to impound [the physical items]. For receivables and other rights to assets, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure on enforcement regarding receivables and other property rights apply accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0168"><!----></a>(2) A written record must be made of the freezing of physical items.

They must be informed of the order and of the time and place of the sale to the extent that the circumstances and the purpose of the measures permit this.</p><p><a name="p0179"><!----></a>(7) The physical item is sold by public auction; Section 979 subsection 1 of the Civil Code applies accordingly. If the auction fails, appears futile from the outset or if the costs of auctioning the physical item would probably exceed the expected revenue, the physical item can be sold directly. The proceeds take the place of the sold physical item. If no buyer is found within an appropriate period, the physical item can be given to a charitable purpose.</p><p><a name="p0180"><!----></a>(8) Frozen physical items can be rendered unusable, destroyed or confiscated if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0181"><!----></a>1.  in the case of a sale the reasons justifying the freezing remain in place or the reasons for freezing would arise afresh,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0182"><!----></a>2.  the sale is not possible for other reasons.</p><p><a name="p0183"><!----></a>This is without prejudice to other statutory provisions which prevent a sale.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0184">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0184"><!----></a>Section 9d<br />Processing of personal data in the tracing and freezing of money and economic assets</p><p><a name="p0185"><!----></a>The competent authority may process personal data to the extent that this is necessary for it to fulfil its tasks under Sections 9a and 9b.
