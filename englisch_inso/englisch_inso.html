Subordinate importance is generally not to be presumed where, in the previous closed business year, the debtor&#700;s total number of employees on an annual average exceeded 15 per cent of the group of companies&#700; total number of employees on an annual average and </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0026"><!----></a>1.  the debtor&#8217;s balance sheet total amounted to more than 15 per cent of the group of companies&#700; combined balance sheet total or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0027"><!----></a>2.  the debtor&#8217;s sales revenues amounted to more than 15 per cent of the group of companies&#700; combined sales revenues.</p><p><a name="p0028"><!----></a>Where several debtor companies in a group of companies have simultaneously filed a request in accordance with sentence 1 or where several requests have been filed and it is not clear which was filed first, the request filed by that debtor which had the most employees in the previous closed business year is decisive; the other requests are not admissible. If none of the debtor companies in the group of companies meets the requirements set out in sentence 2, group jurisdiction can at any rate be established at that court which is competent to open proceedings for that debtor company in the group of companies which had the most employees, on an annual average, in the previous closed business year.</p><p><a name="p0029"><!----></a>(2) Where there are doubts as to whether concentrating the proceedings with the insolvency court seized of the matter is in the creditors&#700; common interest, the court may refuse the request referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1.</p><p><a name="p0030"><!----></a>(3) The debtor&#8217;s right of request transfers to the insolvency administrator upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings and, upon the appointment of a provisional insolvency administrator to whom the power of administration and of disposal concerning the debtor&#8217;s assets has been transferred, to that provisional insolvency administrator.</p><p><a name="p0031"><!----></a>(4) At the debtor&#8217;s request and under the conditions set out in subsection (1), the court which is competent as regards group ancillary proceedings declares that it is also competent, as the restructuring court, as regards group ancillary proceedings in insolvency matters in accordance with subsection (1), that is insofar as it is competent under section 34 of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0032">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0032"><!----></a>Section 3b<br />Continuance of group jurisdiction</p><p><a name="p0033"><!----></a>Group jurisdiction established under section 3a remains unaffected where insolvency proceedings against the debtor filing the request are not opened, are terminated or discontinued for as long as proceedings against another debtor company in the group of companies are pending before that court.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0034">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0034"><!----></a>Section 3c<br />Jurisdiction for group ancillary proceedings</p><p><a name="p0035"><!----></a>(1) The division at the court with group jurisdiction which is responsible for the proceedings in which group jurisdiction has been established is responsible for group ancillary proceedings.</p><p><a name="p0036"><!----></a>(2) The request to open group ancillary proceedings may also be submitted to the court with jurisdiction under section 3 (1).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0037">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0037"><!----></a>Section 3d<br />Referral to court with group jurisdiction </p><p><a name="p0038"><!----></a>(1) Where a request to open insolvency proceedings against the assets of a debtor company in a group of companies is filed with an insolvency court which is not the court with group jurisdiction, the court seized of the matter may refer the proceedings to the court with group jurisdiction.

Section 3a (3) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0040"><!----></a>(3) The court with group jurisdiction may dismiss the provisional insolvency administrator appointed by the first court if this is necessary in order to be able to appoint one person in accordance with section 56b as insolvency administrator for several or all proceedings concerning the debtor companies in a group of companies.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0041">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0041"><!----></a>Section 3e<br />Group of companies</p><p><a name="p0042"><!----></a>(1) For the purposes of this Code, a group of companies comprises legally independent companies whose centre of main interest is in Germany and which are directly or indirectly affiliated on account of </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0043"><!----></a>1.  the possibility of exercising dominant influence or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0044"><!----></a>2.  their being under common management.</p><p><a name="p0045"><!----></a>(2) A company and its personally liable partners is also regarded as a group of companies within the meaning of subsection (1) if these include neither a natural person nor a company which has a natural person as a personally liable partner, or the group of companies continues in this manner.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0046">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0046"><!----></a>Section 4<br />Applicability of Code of Civil Procedure</p><p><a name="p0047"><!----></a>Unless provided otherwise under this Code, the provisions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure (<i>Zivilprozessordnung</i>) apply accordingly to the insolvency proceedings. Section 128a of the Code of Civil Procedure applies, with the proviso that reference is to be made, in summons to creditors&#8217; assemblies and other assemblies and meetings of the parties to the proceedings, to the obligation to not knowingly make audio and video recordings and to ensure, by taking appropriate measures, that third parties are not able to hear or see the audio and video transmission.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0048">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0048"><!----></a>Section 4a<br />Deferment of costs of insolvency proceedings</p><p><a name="p0049"><!----></a>(1) If the debtor is a natural person and has made a request for discharge of residual debt, the costs of the insolvency proceedings are deferred on request until such time as discharge of residual debt is granted, insofar as the debtor&#8217;s assets are likely not to be sufficient to cover these costs. Deferment in accordance with sentence 1 also covers the costs of the proceedings regarding the plan for the settlement of debts and the proceedings for discharge of residual debt. The debtor must enclose with the request a declaration as to whether a ground for refusal under section 290 (1) no. 1 pertains. Deferment is ruled out if such a reason pertains.</p><p><a name="p0050"><!----></a>(2) If the costs of the proceedings are deferred to the debtor, then upon request, a lawyer (<i>Rechtsanwalt</i>) of the debtor&#8217;s choice is appointed who is willing to represent the debtor if representation by counsel appears to be necessary despite the duty of assistance incumbent on the court. Section 121 (3) to (5) of the Code of Civil Procedure applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0051"><!----></a>(3) The effect of deferment is as follows:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0052"><!----></a>1.  the Federal or <i>Land</i> Treasury may claim</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0053"><!----></a>a)  court costs in arrears and those arising,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0054"><!----></a>b)  the claims of the appointed lawyer which transfer to the Treasury</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0055"><!----></a>against the debtor only in accordance with the provisions made by the court;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0056"><!----></a>2.  the appointed lawyer is unable to assert claims for fees against the debtor.</p><p><a name="p0057"><!----></a>Deferment is effected separately in respect of each stage of the proceedings.

Section 115 (1) to (3) and section 120 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure apply accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0060"><!----></a>(2) The court may alter the ruling regarding the deferment and the monthly instalments at any time insofar as any personal or economic circumstances relevant to the deferment have undergone major changes. The debtor is obliged to report to the court a major change in these circumstances without delay. Section 120a (1) sentences 2 and 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies accordingly. A change placing the debtor at a disadvantage is ruled out if four years have passed since termination of the proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0061">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0061"><!----></a>Section 4c<br />Rescission of deferment</p><p><a name="p0062"><!----></a>The court may rescind deferment if</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0063"><!----></a>1.  the debtor intentionally or with gross negligence has provided incorrect information regarding circumstances relevant to the opening of insolvency proceedings or to the deferment, or has not submitted a declaration required by the court regarding his or her circumstances;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0064"><!----></a>2.  the personal or economic conditions for deferment did not apply; in such a case, rescission is ruled out if four years have passed since termination of the proceedings;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0065"><!----></a>3.  the debtor is more than three months in arrears in respect of payment of a monthly instalment or of the payment of another amount and such arrears are the debtor&#8217;s fault;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0066"><!----></a>4.  the debtor is not in appropriate gainful employment and, if unemployed, is not seeking such employment or refuses reasonable activity and thereby impairs the satisfaction of the insolvency creditors; this does not apply in the absence of fault on the part of the debtor; section 296 (2) sentences 2 and 3 applies accordingly;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0067"><!----></a>5.  discharge of residual debt is refused or revoked.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0068">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0068"><!----></a>Section 4d<br />Legal recourse</p><p><a name="p0069"><!----></a>(1) Immediate appeal (sofortige Beschwerde) is available to the debtor against refusal to defer or rescission of deferment, as well as against refusal to appoint a lawyer.</p><p><a name="p0070"><!----></a>(2) If deferment is approved, the Treasury is entitled to file an immediate appeal.

The insolvency court may order that the proceedings or individual stages in the proceedings be conducted as oral proceedings if this is expedient to further the course of the proceedings. It may rescind or change such order at any time. Such order, its rescission or amendment is to be published.</p><p><a name="p0074"><!----></a>(3) The court may render its decisions without an oral hearing. If an oral hearing is held, section 227 (3) sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply.</p><p><a name="p0075"><!----></a>(4) Tables and records may be prepared and processed automatically. The governments of the <i>Länder</i> are empowered to establish more detailed provisions by way of a statutory instrument regarding the keeping of such tables and records, their electronic submission, as well as the electronic submission of accompanying documents and their storage.

The governments of the <i>Länder</i> may delegate such power to the <i>Land</i> departments of justice.</p><p><a name="p0076"><!----></a>(5) Insolvency administrators are, as a rule, to hold available an electronic creditor information system which can be used to make available to each insolvency creditor to have filed a claim, in a standard file format, all the decisions given by the insolvency court, all the reports sent to the insolvency court which do not exclusively concern the claims of other creditors and all the documents concerning their own claims. If the debtor satisfies at least two out of the three criteria referred to in section 22a (1) in the previous business year, then the insolvency administrator must hold available an electronic creditor information system and make the documents referred to in sentence 1 available without delay for electronic retrieval. The administrator without delay provides those entitled to inspect the files access to the necessary data.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0077">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0077"><!----></a>Section 6<br />Immediate appeal</p><p><a name="p0078"><!----></a>(1) Decisions of the insolvency court are subject to an appellate remedy only in those cases where this Code provides for an immediate appeal.

In addition, if a request is filed by the partners of a legal entity or by the members of the supervisory board, the lack of management must also be shown to the satisfaction of the court.

During the period laid down in section 15a (1) sentence 1 and 2 within which a request is deemed to have been filed in good time, this applies only for as long as those obliged to file the request implement measures to permanently eliminate the insolvency or to prepare a request for insolvency with the due care of a prudent and conscientious manager. Payments made in the period between the filing of a request and the opening of proceedings are also deemed to be consistent with the due care of a prudent and conscientious manager if they were made with the consent of the provisional insolvency administrator.</p><p><a name="p0160"><!----></a>(3) If the period laid down in section 15a (1) sentence 1 within which a request is deemed to have been filed in good time has elapsed and those obliged to file the request have filed no request, payments are generally not consistent with the due care of a prudent and conscientious manager.</p><p><a name="p0161"><!----></a>(4) Where payments are made contrary to subsection (1), those in the legal entity obliged to file a request are obliged to refund the payments made. If the legal entity&#8217;s creditors have incurred little damage, then the obligation to refund payments made is limited to compensating for that damage. Where the refund or the compensation is necessary to satisfy the legal entity&#8217;s creditors, the obligation is not ruled out on account of the fact that payment was made on the basis of a decision taken by one of the legal entity&#8217;s bodies. Any waiver on the part of the legal entity to claims to a refund or to compensation or a settlement with the legal entity concerning these claims is ineffective. This does not apply where the entity obliged to pay the refund or compensation is insolvent and settles with its creditors in order to avert insolvency proceedings being opened if the obligation to refund a payment or pay compensation is regulated in an insolvency plan or if an insolvency administrator acts on behalf of the legal entity.</p><p><a name="p0162"><!----></a>(5) Subsection (1) sentence 1 and subsection (4) also apply to payments made to those holding a participating interest in the legal entity insofar as these had to lead to the insolvency of the legal entity, unless this was not recognisable even though the due care described in subsection (1) sentence 2 was applied. Sentence 1 does not apply to cooperatives.</p><p><a name="p0163"><!----></a>(6) Subsections (1) to (5) also apply to the representative bodies of the partners authorised to represent the company which are obliged to file a request under section 15a (1) sentence 3 and (2).</p><p><a name="p0164"><!----></a>(7) The period of limitation on claims arising from the aforementioned provisions is five years. If the company is listed at the point in time at which the breach of an obligation occurs, the period of limitation on claims is 10 years.</p><p><a name="p0165"><!----></a>(8) There has been no breach of obligations to pay tax liabilities where claims resulting from those tax liabilities are not met or not met in good time between the commencement of insolvency as per section 17 or of overindebtedness as per section 19 and the insolvency court&#8217;s decision on the request to open insolvency proceedings, insofar as those obliged to file a request meet their obligations under section 15a. If, contrary to the obligation under section 15a, a request to open insolvency proceedings is filed too late, this only applies to claims resulting from the obligation which become due after the appointment of a provisional insolvency administration or the ordering of provisional debtor-in-possession management. Where insolvency proceedings are not opened owing to a breach of obligation on the part of those obliged to make the request, sentences 1 and 2 do not apply.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0166">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0166"><!----></a>Section 16<br />Reason to open insolvency proceedings</p><p><a name="p0167"><!----></a>The opening of insolvency proceedings requires the existence of a reason to open such proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0168">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0168"><!----></a>Section 17<br />Insolvency</p><p><a name="p0169"><!----></a>(1) Insolvency is the general reason to open insolvency proceedings.</p><p><a name="p0170"><!----></a>(2) Debtors are deemed illiquid if they are unable to meet their mature obligations to pay.

Such obligation to make recompensing payments only exists to the extent to which the loss in value accruing from such use impairs the security of the creditor with a right to separate satisfaction.
