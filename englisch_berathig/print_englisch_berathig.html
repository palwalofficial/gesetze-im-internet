The possibility of being advised or represented by a lawyer free of charge or on the basis of a contingent fee agreement is not another possibility for assistance within the meaning of subsection 1 no. 2.</p><p><a name="p0019"><!----></a>(3) Frivolity is deemed to exist if advisory assistance is to be claimed although litigants who may not claim advisory assistance on the basis of their personal and economic circumstances would refrain from obtaining legal advice or representation at their own expense upon due consideration of all the circumstances of the legal matter. In assessing frivolity, litigants&#8217; knowledge and abilities and their specific economic situation are to be taken into account.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0020">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0020"><!----></a>Section 2<br />Subject of the advisory assistance</p><p><a name="p0021"><!----></a>(1) Advisory assistance consists of advice and, if necessary, representation.

If litigants do not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany, the local court in the district in which the need for advisory assistance occurs has jurisdiction.</p><p><a name="p0033"><!----></a>(2) The application may be made orally or in writing; section 130a of the Code of Civil Procedure and statutory instruments issued on its basis apply accordingly. The situation for which the application for advisory assistance is being made must be indicated.</p><p><a name="p0034"><!----></a>(3) The following documents must be included with the application:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0035"><!----></a>1. a statement by litigants concerning their personal and economic circumstances, especially information concerning their marital status, profession, assets, income and expenditures, as well as the relevant evidence and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0036"><!----></a>2. an assurance by litigants that they have not previously been granted advisory assistance concerning the same matter and have not been refused it by a court, and that no court proceedings are or were pending concerning the same matter.</p><p><a name="p0037"><!----></a>(4) The court may demand that litigants substantiate their statements of fact, and in particular may also demand that a statutory declaration be made in lieu of an oath. It may make assessments; specifically, it may order the submission of documents and obtain information. Witnesses and experts are not to be heard.</p><p><a name="p0038"><!----></a>(5) If, within a period set by the court, litigants fail to substantiate information they have provided regarding their personal and economic circumstances, or if they fail to answer certain questions or do not answer them to the satisfaction of the court, the court will refuse to approve advisory assistance.</p><p><a name="p0039"><!----></a>(6) In cases where the application is made retroactively (section 6 (2)), consultants may demand, before the start of advisory assistance, that litigants furnish evidence of their personal and economic circumstances, and declare that they have not previously been granted advisory assistance concerning the same matter and have not been refused it by a court, and that no court proceedings are or were pending concerning the same matter.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0040">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0040"><!----></a>Section 5<br />Applicable provisions</p><p><a name="p0041"><!----></a>The provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-contentious Jurisdiction (Gesetz über das Verfahren in Familiensachen und in den Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit &#8211; FamFG) apply to the proceedings accordingly unless this Act determines otherwise.

In such a case, the application must be made no later than four weeks after the beginning of the advisory assistance activity.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0046">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0046"><!----></a>Section 6a<br />Revocation of approval</p><p><a name="p0047"><!----></a>(1) The court may revoke approval ex officio if the conditions for advisory assistance had not been met at the time of the approval and no more than one year has lapsed since the approval.</p><p><a name="p0048"><!----></a>(2) Consultants may apply for the approval to be revoked if litigants have obtained something on the basis of the advice or representation for which the advisory assistance was approved for them. An application may only be made if consultants</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0049"><!----></a>1. have not yet applied for remuneration for advisory assistance under section 44 sentence 1 of the Act on the Remuneration of Lawyers (Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz &#8211; RVG) and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0050"><!----></a>2. have informed litigants in writing when accepting the mandate of the possibility of filing an application and of revocation of the approval as well as of the consequences for remuneration under section 8a (2).</p><p><a name="p0051"><!----></a>The court must revoke the decision on the approval of advisory assistance after hearing litigants if the latter no longer meet the conditions for the approval of advisory assistance with regard to their personal and economic circumstances on account of what they have obtained.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0052">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0052"><!----></a>Section 7<br />Legal remedy</p><p><a name="p0053"><!----></a>Only reminders serving as a legal remedy are permitted against a decision rejecting an application for the approval of advisory assistance or revoking approval ex officio or upon the application of a consultant.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0054">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0054"><!----></a>Section 8<br />Remuneration</p><p><a name="p0055"><!----></a>(1) The consultant&#8217;s remuneration is based on the provisions of the Act on the Remuneration of Lawyers applicable to advisory assistance. To this extent, a consultant who is not a lawyer is equivalent to a lawyer.</p><p><a name="p0056"><!----></a>(2) Where advisory assistance is approved, this will have the effect that consultants may not assert claims to remuneration against litigants except for the fee for advisory assistance (section 44 sentence 2 of the Act on the Remuneration of Lawyers). This also applies in cases where applications are made retroactively (section 6 (2)) until a decision has been taken by the court.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0057">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0057"><!----></a>Section 8a<br />Consequences of the revocation of approval</p><p><a name="p0058"><!----></a>(1) If the approval of advisory assistance is revoked, the consultants&#8217; claim against the state treasury for remuneration remains unaffected. This does not apply if consultants</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0059"><!----></a>1. had knowledge or grossly negligent lack of knowledge of the fact that the conditions for the approval of advisory assistance had not been met at the time of the payment of advisory assistance, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0060"><!----></a>2. applied for the revocation of advisory assistance themselves (section 6a (2)).</p><p><a name="p0061"><!----></a>(2) Consultants may demand remuneration from litigants in accordance with the general provisions if they</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0062"><!----></a>1. do not demand or retain any remuneration from the state treasury and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0063"><!----></a>2. if they informed litigants of the possibility of the revocation of the approval upon accepting the mandate and of the resulting consequences for remuneration.</p><p><a name="p0064"><!----></a>Insofar as litigants have already paid the fee for advisory assistance (no. 2500 of Annex 1 to the Act on the Remuneration of Lawyers), this is set off against the claim for remuneration.</p><p><a name="p0065"><!----></a>(3) If the approval of advisory assistance is revoked because the personal and economic conditions were not met, the state treasury may demand from litigants the reimbursement of the amount paid by it to consultants and retained by them.</p><p><a name="p0066"><!----></a>(4) If in the case of a retroactive application, advisory assistance is not approved, consultants may demand remuneration from litigants according to the general provisions if they informed them of this upon accepting the mandate.
