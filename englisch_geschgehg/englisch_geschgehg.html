This does not apply if the court dealing with the main proceedings has denied the existence of the trade secret that is the subject of proceedings by a judgment that has become final and binding or as soon as the information that is the subject of proceedings becomes generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0109">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0109"><!----></a>Section 19<br />Other judicial limitations</p><p><a name="p0110"><!----></a>(1) In addition to section 16 (1), the court dealing with the main proceedings, upon application by a party, limits access, in full or in part, to a certain number of reliable persons, in order to safeguard trade secrets</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0111"><!----></a>1.&#160;&#160;to documents submitted or presented by the parties or third parties that may contain trade secrets, or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0112"><!----></a>2.&#160;&#160;to the hearing at which trade secrets could be disclosed, and to the recording or minutes of the hearing.</p><p><a name="p0113"><!----></a>That applies only to the extent that, after consideration of all circumstances, the interest in maintaining secrecy overrides the participants&#8217; right to be heard, also taking into consideration their right to effective legal redress and fair proceedings. Access is to be granted to at least one natural person of each party and their counsels or other representatives. In all other cases, the court determines at its own discretion which orders are necessary to achieve the objective.</p><p><a name="p0114"><!----></a>(2) If the court imposes limits under subsection (1) sentence 1,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0115"><!----></a>1.&#160;&#160;the general public may be excluded from the hearing upon application and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0116"><!----></a>2.&#160;&#160;section 16 (3) does not apply to admitted persons.</p><p><a name="p0117"><!----></a>(3) Sections 16 to 19 (1) and (2) apply accordingly in compulsory enforcement proceedings if the court dealing with the main proceedings has classified Information under section 16 (1) as sensitive or has imposed additional limitations under subsection (1) sentence 1.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0118">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0118"><!----></a>Section 20<br />Proceedings in the case of measures under sections 16 to 19</p><p><a name="p0119"><!----></a>(1) The court dealing with the main proceedings may order a limitation under section 16 (1) and section 19 (1) when a court dispute is pending.</p><p><a name="p0120"><!----></a>(2) The other party is to be heard by the court no later than after the measure has been ordered.

In the case of section 19 (1) sentence 1 no. 1, it must also submit a version that may be inspected without divulging trade secrets. If no such version, where the trade secrets have been made illegible, is submitted, the court may assume consent to inspection unless the court is aware of special circumstances that do not justify such an assumption.</p><p><a name="p0123"><!----></a>(5) The court decides on the application by decree. If it grants the application, it must draw the attention of the participants to the effect of the decree under section 16 (2) and section 18 and consequences of a breach under section 17. If the court intends to dismiss the application, it is to draw the applicant party&#8217;s attention to this and to the reasons for it and to give it an opportunity to make a statement within a period to be determined. Categorisation as sensitive in accordance with section 16 (1) and an order of limitation in accordance with section 19 (1) may only be contested together, with the appellate remedy in the main proceedings. In all other cases, an immediate complaint may be filed.</p><p><a name="p0124"><!----></a>(6) The court dealing with the main proceedings within the meaning of this Division is</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0125"><!----></a>1.&#160;&#160;the court of first instance or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0126"><!----></a>2.&#160;&#160;the appeal court if the main proceedings are pending with the appellate instance on fact and law.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0127">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0127"><!----></a>Section 21<br />Announcement of the judgment</p><p><a name="p0128"><!----></a>(1) The party that has prevailed in a trade secret dispute may, upon application, be given authority in the operative provisions of the judgment to publicly announce the judgment or information about the judgment at the cost of the party that has not prevailed if the party that has prevailed demonstrates a legitimate interest in so doing.
