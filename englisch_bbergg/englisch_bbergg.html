An interruption of operations lasting up to two years shall be deemed continuation of operations, and a longer interruption shall be deemed such only if approved of by the competent authority. The competent authority can stipulate that main operating plans can also be prepared for a longer period than two years, if a monitoring of the operation is still possible given a longer lifetime for the main operating plan, especially if the course of operations is foreseeable. It can generally be expected that the operation can be monitored where the main operating plan covers a longer period in the context of the envisaged cessation of opencast lignite mining on the basis of the Act to Reduce and End Coal-Fired Power Generation. In the cases of sentences 3 and 4, the stipulated duration should not exceed four years.</p><p><a name="p0355"><!----></a>(2) The competent authority may request that</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0356"><!----></a>1.  general operating plans cover a longer specified timeframe, depending on individual circumstances, and must include general information on the project, its technical execution and projected timeframe;</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0357"><!----></a>2.  special operating plans be prepared for specific parts of operations or for specific projects.</p><p><a name="p0358"><!----></a>(2a) A general operating plan is required and a planning approval procedure pursuant to the provisions of Sections 57a and 57b shall be executed for its approval if a project in line with the Ordinance pursuant to Section 57c in conjunction with the provisions of Part 2 Division 1 of the Act on the Assessment of Environmental Impacts requires an environmental impact assessment. In the case of a project which on its own or in combination with other projects or plans could pose a serious risk to a Natura 2000 area, the environmental impact assessment pursuant to Section 34 subsection 1 of the Federal Nature Conservation Act shall be undertaken together with the environmental impact assessment in the planning approval procedure pursuant to sentence 1. Any preventive pollution control measures required by the environmental impact assessment that go beyond the approval requirements set out in Section 55 and in provisions of other laws applicable to the project are deemed public interest as provided for in Section 48 (2).</p><p><a name="p0359"><!----></a>(2b) For projects and any necessary subsequent measures that are carried out in separate steps or phases for reasons of geographic or temporal scope, the general operating plan as stipulated in (2a) sentence 1 may be prepared and approved in accordance with the steps or phases, unless this makes it entirely or partly impossible to correctly assess the substantial impact of the project as a whole on the environment. Projects requiring a special procedure as provided for in Section 54 (2) sentence 3 shall not be subject to the provisions of (2a), Section 11 (1) of the Water Resources Act and Section 17 (10) of the Nature Conservation Act and corresponding provisions in other laws and regulations on methods for conducting the environmental impact assessment, if this special procedure guarantees an environmental impact assessment that complies with the requirements of this Act.
