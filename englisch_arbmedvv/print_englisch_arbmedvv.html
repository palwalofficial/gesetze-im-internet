He or she must thereby comply with the provisions of this Ordinance, including the Annex, and take into consideration the regulations and findings published in accordance with section 9 (4). When complying with the regulations and findings referred to in sentence 2, it must be assumed that the requirements set have been fulfilled. Preventive occupational health care may also comprise additional preventive health care measures.</p><p><a name="p0030"><!----></a>(2) In accordance with section 7, the employer must commission a physician with the provision of preventive occupational health care. Where an occupational physician has been appointed in accordance with section 2 of the Occupational Safety Act, the employer is to give priority to him or her when commissioning the provision of preventive occupational health care. The physician must be given all the necessary information regarding work place conditions, in particular the occasion for the preventive occupational health care and the outcome of the risk assessment, and he or she must be allowed access to inspect the workplace. He or she must, upon request, be allowed access to the documents referred to in paragraph 4 sentence 3.</p><p><a name="p0031"><!----></a>(3) Preventive occupational health care is to be provided during working hours. If the risk assessment for the worker&#8217;s/workers&#8217; activity/activities results in the necessity to check several risks preventive occupational health care must take place during a single appointment. Preventive occupational health care is not to be provided in conjunction with examinations which serve to prove fitness for work to meet professional requirements, unless there are operational reasons for doing so; in such cases, the employer must obligate the physician to reveal to the worker the various purposes of preventive occupational health care and the fitness test.</p><p><a name="p0032"><!----></a>(4) The employer is to keep file records containing information regarding the fact that, when and on what occasions preventive occupational health care was provided; the file records may be kept in automated form. The information must be retained until the employment relationship ends and must then be deleted, unless legal provisions or the regulations published in accordance with section 9 (4) provide otherwise. The employer has to transmit a copy of the file records to the competent authority by order. When the employment relationship ends the employer has to hand over to the person concerned a copy of the information concerning him or her; section 34 of the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz &#8212; BDSG) remains unaffected.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0033">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0033"><!----></a>Section 4<br />Mandatory health care</p><p><a name="p0034"><!----></a>(1) The employer must occasion mandatory health care for workers in accordance with the provisions of the Annex. Mandatory health care must be occasioned before an activity is taken up and thereafter at regular intervals.</p><p><a name="p0035"><!----></a>(2) The employer may only have an activity performed if the worker has taken part in the mandatory health care.</p><p><a name="p0036"><!----></a>(3) (repealed)</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0037">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0037"><!----></a>Section 5<br />Optional health care</p><p><a name="p0038"><!----></a>(1) The employer must offer workers optional health care in accordance with the provisions of the Annex. Optional health care must be offered before an activity is taken up and thereafter at regular intervals. Where a worker rejects the offer, this does not release the employer from the obligation to offer further regular optional health care.</p><p><a name="p0039"><!----></a>(2) If the employer learns of an illness which may have been caused by the worker&#8217;s activity, he must immediately offer him or her optional health care. This also applies to workers performing comparable activities if there are indications that they may also be at risk.</p><p><a name="p0040"><!----></a>(3) The employer must offer workers and former workers follow-up preventive health care in accordance with the provisions of the Annex after they stop performing certain activities which may lead to health problems after extended latency periods. At the end of the employment relationship the employer&#8217;s obligation transfers to the competent statutory accident insurance provider, and he or she has to hand over a copy of all the necessary documents insofar as the worker has agreed thereto.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0041">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0041"><!----></a>Section 5a<br />Elective health care</p><p><a name="p0042"><!----></a>Over and above the provisions set out in the Annex, the employer has to make regular preventive occupational health care under section 11 of the Safety and Health at Work Act available to workers at their request unless no health damage is to be expected on the basis of the evaluation of the conditions of work and the protective measures taken.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0043">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0043"><!----></a>Section 6<br />Obligations on the physician</p><p><a name="p0044"><!----></a>(1) The physician must comply with the provisions of this Ordinance, including the Annex, when providing preventive occupational health care and must give consideration to the regulations and findings corresponding to the state of occupational medicine. Before providing preventive occupational health care he or she must obtain the necessary knowledge regarding the conditions of work. The work anamnesis must comprise all working conditions and work-related hazards. Before carrying out physical or clinical examinations the physician must examine their necessity at his or her dutiful medical discretion and must inform the worker about the content, purpose and risks of the examination. Examinations in accordance with sentence 3 may not be carried out against the worker&#8217;s will. The physician must observe medical confidentiality.</p><p><a name="p0045"><!----></a>(2) Biomonitoring is a part of preventive occupational health care insofar as analytical methods recognised by occupational medicine and suitable evaluation values are available. Biomonitoring may not be carried out against the worker&#8217;s will. Vaccinations are a part of preventive occupational health care and must be offered to workers insofar as the risk of infection is activity-related and greater than in the general population. Sentence 3 does not apply if the worker already has sufficient immunity.</p><p><a name="p0046"><!----></a>(3) The physician has to</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0047"><!----></a>1. record the results and the findings of the preventive occupational health care appointment in writing and discuss these results and findings with the worker,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0048"><!----></a>2. make the results available to the worker at his or her request and</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0049"><!----></a>3. issue the worker and the employer with an attestation regarding the fact that, when and on what occasion a preventive occupational health appointment was held; the attestation also includes information on when another preventive occupational health care appointment is necessary from a medical point of view.</p><p><a name="p0050"><!----></a>(4) The physician has to analyse the preventive occupational health care findings. Where these provide indications that the measures of occupational safety and health taken in regard to the worker or workers are not sufficient, the physician must inform the employer thereof and make recommendations regarding measures of occupational safety and health. Where the physician feels it is necessary for the worker to change jobs for medical reasons which purely relate to the worker&#8217;s person, such notification to the employer requires the consent of the worker.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0051">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0051"><!----></a>Section 7<br />Requirements for the physician</p><p><a name="p0052"><!----></a>(1) Notwithstanding other provisions in the Annex regarding individual occasions for the provision of preventive occupational health care, the physician must be authorised to use the designation &#8220;Occupational Medicine&#8221; (Arbeitsmedizin) or the additional designation &#8220;Industrial Medicine&#8221; (Betriebsmedizin).
