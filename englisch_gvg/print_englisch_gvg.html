The reasonableness of the length of proceedings shall be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the particular case concerned, in particular the complexity thereof, the importance of what was at stake in the case, and the conduct of the participants and of third persons therein.</p><p><a name="p0941"><!----></a>(2) A disadvantage not constituting a pecuniary disadvantage shall be presumed to have occurred in a case where a set of court proceedings has been of unreasonably long duration. Compensation can be claimed therefor only insofar as reparation by other means, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case, is not sufficient in accordance with subsection (4). Compensation pursuant to sentence 2 shall amount to EUR 1,200 for every year of the delay. Where having regard to the circumstances of the particular case the sum pursuant to sentence 3 is inequitable, the court can assess a higher or lower sum.</p><p><a name="p0942"><!----></a>(3) A participant in proceedings shall obtain compensation only if he has complained about the length of the proceedings to the court seized of the case (censure of delay). A censure of delay can be filed only if there is cause to fear that the case will not be concluded within a reasonable time; a censure of delay can be reiterated at the earliest after six months, but not in a case where a shorter duration is necessary by way of exception. Where expedition of the proceedings depends on factors that have not yet been introduced into the proceedings, reference shall be made thereto in the complaint. Otherwise, in the assessment of the reasonable length of proceedings, account shall not be taken of these factors by the court required to give the decision on compensation (court of compensation). Where the proceedings are further delayed before another court, it shall be necessary to file a new censure of delay.</p><p><a name="p0943"><!----></a>(4) Reparation by other means shall be possible in particular where the court of compensation makes a finding that the length of the proceedings was unreasonable.
