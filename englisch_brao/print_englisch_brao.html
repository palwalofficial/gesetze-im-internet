The Central Register must indicate of which bar association each lawyer and each licensed professional practice company is a member. Before making a new entry the bar associations carry out an identification procedure. They are responsible in data protection matters as regards the data entered, in particular for the accuracy and lawfulness of their data collection.</p><p><a name="p0131"><!----></a>(2) The registers of the bar associations and the Central Register serve to provide information to the authorities and courts, consumers of legal services and other persons involved in legal relations.

Entries are then deleted after an appropriate period. If the lawyer&#8217;s membership ends on account of his or her becoming a member of another bar association, correction is to take the place of blocking or deletion of the entry in the Central Register. Where a liquidator has been appointed, data are not blocked; any blocking already effected is to be reversed.

After setting up a special electronic legal mailbox, the Federal Bar Association communicates its designation to the relevant bar association for storage in that bar association&#8217;s register.</p><p><a name="p0166"><!----></a>(2) For the purpose of setting up the special electronic legal mailbox, the bar association communicates to the Federal Bar Association the family name, given name(s) and a delivery address of those persons who have filed an application for admission to the bar association. In the case of in-house lawyers, information is also to be provided as to whether the activity is pursued in the context of several employment relationships. The information communicated is to be deleted where the application is withdrawn or admission to the bar association is denied by final decision.</p><p><a name="p0167"><!----></a>(3) The Federal Bar Association must ensure that access to the special electronic legal mailbox is possible only by means of a secure procedure using two separate and independent security measures.

If the entry concerning the additional law office is deleted from the Central Register, the Federal Bar Association revokes access authorisation to the additional special electronic legal mailbox and deletes it as soon as it is no longer required.

The application referred to in sentence 1 is to be sent to the bar association to which the professional practice company has been or is to be admitted. The bar association transmits to the Federal Bar Association the name and address of the branch office for which a further special electronic legal mailbox is to be set up. The Federal Bar Association revokes access authorisation to a further special electronic legal mailbox set up as required under sentence 1 where a professional practice company declares to its competent bar association that it no longer wishes to have a further special electronic legal mailbox for the branch office or if the branch office is closed; in all other cases, subsection (3) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0177"><!----></a>(5) In all other cases, section 31a (1) sentence 2, (2) sentence 3, (3), (4) sentence 2 and (6) and (7) applies accordingly to special electronic legal mailboxes set up as required under subsections (1) and (4).</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0178">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0178"><!----></a>Section 31c<br />Register of European Lawyers</p><p><a name="p0179"><!----></a>In addition to a search pursuant to section 31 (2) sentence 3, the Federal Bar Association enables a search, via the electronic search system available on the website of the European Commission (Register of European Lawyers), of that information entered in the Central Register which is included in the Register of European Lawyers.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0180">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0180"><!----></a>Section 31d<br />Authorisation to issue statutory instruments</p><p><a name="p0181"><!----></a>The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection issues statutory instruments requiring the approval of the Bundesrat to lay down specific rules concerning</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0182"><!----></a>1.  the collection of data to be entered in the bar associations&#8217; electronic registers, the keeping of these registers and inspection of these registers,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0183"><!----></a>2.  the collection of data to be entered in the Central Register, the keeping of the Central Register and inspection of the Central Register,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0184"><!----></a>3.  the special electronic legal mailboxes, in particular details concerning</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0185"><!----></a>a)  their setting up and the data which need to be communicated for this purpose,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0186"><!----></a>b)  their technical configuration, including their accessibility,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0187"><!----></a>c)  their maintenance,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0188"><!----></a>d)  access authorisation and use,</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0189"><!----></a>e)  the deletion of messages and</p><p class="Liste2"><a name="p0190"><!----></a>f)  their deletion,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0191"><!----></a>4.  retrieval of information from the Central Register via the Register of European Lawyers.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0192">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0192"><!----></a>Division 3<br />Administrative procedures</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0193">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0193"><!----></a>Section 32<br />Supplementary application of administrative procedure law</p><p><a name="p0194"><!----></a>(1) Unless otherwise provided, then in respect of administrative procedures under this Code or under a statutory instrument issued on the basis of this Code, the Administrative Procedure Act (<i>Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz</i>) applies to federal authorities and the administrative procedure acts of the <i>Länder</i> apply to the <i>Länder</i> authorities.

This obligation applies to everything which becomes known to a lawyer in the exercise of his or her profession. It does not apply to facts which are obvious or which, by dint of their importance, do not necessitate confidentiality. A lawyer is required to oblige those persons in his or her employ, in text form, to maintain confidentiality and to advise them of the consequences under criminal law of any violation of that obligation. Further, a lawyer must take suitable measures to ensure compliance with the obligation to maintain confidentiality. Persons employed by the lawyer are equal to persons who are involved in his or her professional activities as part of preparations for their own professional activity or in another auxiliary capacity. Sentence 4 does not apply to trainee lawyers (<i>Referendare</i>) and persons employed who are subject to the same requirements as the lawyer as regards the obligation to maintain confidentiality. Where a lawyer has associated himself or herself for the joint exercise of the profession with other persons who are subject to the same requirements as regards the obligation to maintain confidentiality and employees have a single employment relationship, it is also sufficient to provide proof that one of these other persons has committed to the obligation referred to in sentence 4.</p><p><a name="p0230"><!----></a>(3) A lawyer may not behave in an unobjective manner in the exercise of his or her profession.

This ban also applies to lawyers exercising their profession jointly with a lawyer who is not permitted to act in a professional capacity as per sentence 1. A ban as referred to in sentence 2 continues to apply if the lawyer excluded on the basis of sentence 1 terminates the joint professional practice. Sentences 2 and 3 do not apply where the clients concerned have consented to the lawyer acting in a professional capacity after being given comprehensive information in text form and suitable safeguards having been put in place to ensure that the lawyer abides by the obligation to maintain confidentiality. A ban on acting in a professional capacity issued in accordance with sentence 1 against a professional practice company lapses where the conditions of sentence 4 are met. Where necessary in order to review a ban on acting in a professional capacity under sentence 1 or sentence 2, facts subject to the obligation to maintain confidentiality may be disclosed to a lawyer even without the client&#8217;s consent.</p><p><a name="p0232"><!----></a>(5) Subsection (4) sentence 1 applies accordingly to the activities of trainee lawyers undergoing their preparatory service in the context of their training with a lawyer.

A lawyer may specialise in administrative law, tax law, labour law and social law, as well as in those fields of law laid down in the rules of professional conduct pursuant to section 59a (2) no. 2 (a).

Such appearance is, as a rule, to be ordered if the executive board or the nominated member of the executive board comes to the conclusion, after examining the matter, that this might facilitate a settlement.</p><p><a name="p0408"><!----></a>(3) A lawyer is required to notify the executive board of the bar association without delay</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0409"><!----></a>1.  that he or she will be entering an employment relationship or that a key change will be made to an existing employment relationship,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0410"><!----></a>2.  that he or she will permanently or temporarily be serving as a judge, civil servant, regular solider or fixed-term volunteer soldier,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0411"><!----></a>3.  that he or she holds public office within the meaning of section 47 (2).</p><p><a name="p0412"><!----></a>Upon request, documents concerning an employment relationship are to be submitted to the executive board of the bar association.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0413">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0413"><!----></a>Section 57<br />Penalty payment for breach of special obligations</p><p><a name="p0414"><!----></a>(1) The executive board of a bar association may impose a penalty payment against a lawyer, even more than once, in order to prompt the lawyer to fulfil the obligations laid down in section 56. The penalty payment may not exceed 1,000 euros in each instance.</p><p><a name="p0415"><!----></a>(2) Imposition of the penalty payment must first be threatened in writing by the executive board or the president of the bar association. The threat and assessment of the penalty payment are to be served on the lawyer.</p><p><a name="p0416"><!----></a>(3) The lawyer may apply for a decision from the higher lawyers&#8217; court against the threat and against the assessment of the penalty payment within one month of service thereof. The application is to be submitted to the executive board of the bar association in writing. If the executive board deems the application to be well-founded, the executive board is to grant relief; otherwise, the application is to be submitted to the higher lawyers&#8217; court without delay. Jurisdiction lies with the higher lawyers&#8217; court at the higher regional court in whose district the bar association has been established. Sections 307 to 309 and 311a of the Code of Criminal Procedure apply analogously. Submissions in response (section 308 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure) are rendered by the executive board of the bar association. The public prosecution office is not involved in such proceedings. The decision of the higher lawyers&#8217; court cannot be challenged. Section 116 (2) applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0417"><!----></a>(4) The penalty payment accrues to the bar association. Payment is exacted in accordance with those provisions which are applicable to the enforcement of judgments in civil-law disputes on the basis of a certified copy of the assessment notice issued by the treasurer and accompanied by a certificate of enforceability. Section 767 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies, with the proviso that objections concerning the claim itself are permissible only if they could not be asserted in proceedings pursuant to subsection (3) Such objections are to be asserted by way of a legal action before the court designated in section 797 (5) of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0418">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0418"><!----></a>Section 58<br />Membership files</p><p><a name="p0419"><!----></a>(1) The bar associations keep files on their members (section 60 (2)) for the purpose of performing their duties. Membership files may be kept electronically in part or in full. Membership files are to include, in particular, those documents which relate to a member&#8217;s admission, membership or qualification or which concern proceedings relating to that member&#8217;s professional supervision.</p><p><a name="p0420"><!----></a>(2) Members of the bar associations have the right to inspect their membership file. In the course of such inspection of the files, records of the content of the files or copies of the documents may be made. Where membership files are kept electronically, the bar association is required to provide access to the content of these files electronically or to make copies available. Inspection of the files may be refused for as long as the reasons referred to in section 29 (1) sentence 2 and (2) of the Administrative Procedure Act and in section 147 (2) sentence 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure exist.</p><p><a name="p0421"><!----></a>(3) Where a member applies for admission to another bar association, the previous bar association forwards that member&#8217;s membership file to the other bar association. Once the member has been admitted to the new bar association, the previous bar association deletes all the member&#8217;s personal data, with the exception of reference to the fact that the member has moved to another bar association and other data which it may require in the course of performing its duties.</p><p><a name="p0422"><!----></a>(4) Membership files are to be destroyed 30 years following the end of that year in which membership of the bar association expired. Deviating obligations to destroy parts of the files at an earlier point in time remain unaffected. Sentence 1 does not apply if the member has consented to the file being retained for a longer period or the file is offered to a public archive. Where the member&#8217;s admission was withdrawn or revoked on account of unreliability, unsuitability or unworthiness or the member was disbarred, the file may not be destroyed before the relevant entry in the Federal Central Criminal Register has been removed. Sentence 4 also applies where a member has waived admission in proceedings to withdraw or revoke admission on account of unreliability, unsuitability or unworthiness. Where the files are kept electronically, deletion of the data takes the place of destruction of the files.</p><p><a name="p0423"><!----></a>(5) Following the death of one of its members, the bar association may grant inspection of that member&#8217;s file for the purposes of scientific research insofar as the scientific interest overrides the personal rights and interests of the data subject and the purpose of the research cannot be achieved by any other means or only with a disproportionate effort.</p><p><a name="p0424"><!----></a>(6) Subsections (1), (2), (4) and (5) apply accordingly to persons who have applied for admission as a lawyer or for licensing as a professional practice company.

Section 113 (2) and (4), section 115b, section 118 (1) and (2) and sections 118a and 118b apply accordingly. Section 115 (1) sentences 1 and 3 and (2) applies to the statute of limitations and its suspension.

Submissions in response (section 308 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure) are to be rendered by the executive board of the bar association. The public prosecution office is not involved in such proceedings. A hearing is held if the lawyer files an application therefor or the lawyers&#8217; disciplinary court deems it to be necessary. The executive board of the bar association, the lawyer and his or her defence counsel are to be informed of the time and place of the hearing. The manner and extent of the taking of evidence is determined by the lawyers&#8217; disciplinary court. However, in establishing the truth it is, ex officio, to extend the taking of evidence to all the facts and evidence which are relevant to the decision.</p><p><a name="p0671"><!----></a>(3) The notice of reprimand may not be revoked on account of the executive board of the bar association having wrongly assumed that the lawyer&#8217;s guilt was minor and that it was not necessary to apply for the institution of lawyers&#8217; disciplinary proceedings. If the conditions under which a lawyers&#8217; disciplinary court is to refrain from imposing a measure pursuant to section 115b are met or the conditions under which lawyers&#8217; disciplinary proceedings cannot be instituted or continued pursuant to section 118 (2) do not arise until after the executive board has issued the reprimand, the lawyers&#8217; disciplinary court revokes the notice of reprimand.

Permission to testify is granted at the reasonable discretion of the executive board of the bar association. Permission is, as a rule, only to be denied where this is irrefutably necessary on account of having to take account of the status or the tasks of the bar association or the legitimate interests of the persons about whom facts have become known.
