The club shall issue the supervisor with a corresponding document confirming his competence and qualifications in this respect. The supervisor shall carry this document on his person while performing his supervisory duties and shall hand the document over to authorised persons for inspection on request. For the purposes of verification pursuant to sentence 4, the club shall permit authorised persons to view the supervisor's registration on request.
