A generic medicinal product authorised pursuant to this provision is not to be placed on the market until ten years have elapsed following the first authorisation of the reference medicinal product. The period referred to in sentence 2 will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of authorisation, the marketing authorisation holder obtains authorisation for one or more new therapeutic indications that during the scientific evaluation conducted prior to their authorisation by the competent higher federal authority are held to bring significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.</p><p><a name="p0656"><!----></a>(2) Authorisation as a generic medicinal product pursuant to subsection (1) requires that the medicinal product in question has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active substances and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product and that the bioequivalence has been demonstrated in bioavailability studies. The different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active substance are considered to be one and the same active substance unless their properties differ significantly with regard to safety or efficacy. In such cases, the applicant must submit additional proof of the safety or efficacy of the different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixture of isomers, complexes or derivatives of the active substance. The various immediate release oral pharmaceutical forms are considered to be one and the same pharmaceutical form. The applicant is not required to submit bioavailability studies if he/she can otherwise demonstrate that the generic medicinal product meets the relevant bioequivalence criteria in accordance with current scientific knowledge. In cases where the medicinal product does not meet the requirements of a generic medicinal product or where the bioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through bioequivalence studies or in the case of a change in the active substance, therapeutic indication, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration vis-à-vis the reference medicinal product, the results of appropriate preclinical tests or clinical trials are to be provided.</p><p><a name="p0657"><!----></a>(3) If the reference medicinal product was not authorised by the competent higher federal authority but by the competent authority of another Member State, the applicant must indicate, in the application form, where the reference medicinal product is or has been authorised. In this case, the competent higher federal authority asks the competent authority of the other Member State to transmit within one month a confirmation that the reference medicinal product is or has been authorised, together with the full composition of the reference medicinal product and other documents relevant to the authorisation of the generic medicinal product. In the case where the reference medicinal product has been authorised by the European Medicines Agency, the competent higher federal authority asks the latter for the information and documents referred to in sentence 2.</p><p><a name="p0658"><!----></a>(4) If the competent authority of another Member State where an application is submitted requests information or documents referred to in subsection (3) sentence 2 of the competent higher federal authority, the latter must respond to this request within one month, provided that at least eight years have elapsed since the reference medicinal product was first authorised.</p><p><a name="p0659"><!----></a>(5) Where a biological medicinal product that is similar to a biological reference medicinal product does not meet the conditions for generic medicinal products referred to in subsection (2) owing to, in particular, differences relating to raw materials or differences between the manufacturing processes of the biological medicinal product and the reference biological medicinal product, the results of appropriate preclinical tests or clinical trials relating to these deviations are to be provided. The type and quantity of the supplementary data to be provided must comply with the relevant criteria according to current scientific knowledge. The results of other tests from the documents submitted for the reference medicinal product&#8217;s authorisation are not to be provided.</p><p><a name="p0660"><!----></a>(6) In addition to the provisions laid down in subsection (1), where an application is made for a new therapeutic indication for a known active substance that has been in general medical use for at least ten years in the European Union, a non-cumulative period of one year of data exclusivity is to be granted for the data gained from significant preclinical or clinical studies carried out in connection with the new therapeutic indication.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0661">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0661"><!----></a>Section 24c<br />Additional requests</p><p><a name="p0662"><!----></a>If several holders of a marketing authorisation have to be requested to submit additional documents, the competent higher federal authority notifies every holder of a marketing authorisation of the documents necessary for the further assessment as well as of the names and addresses of the other holders of a marketing authorisation who are involved. The competent higher federal authority gives those holders of the marketing authorisation who are involved the opportunity to decide among themselves as to who will submit the documents within a period of time to be determined by the authority. If an agreement is not reached, the competent higher federal authority decides and immediately informs all persons concerned. Unless the other holders of a marketing authorisation choose to forgo the marketing authorisation granted for their own pharmaceutical product, they are obliged to contribute proportionally to the expenditure incurred in the preparation of the documents, calculated according to the number of marketing authorisation holders involved; they are jointly and severally liable. Sentences 1 to 4 apply accordingly to persons using standard marketing authorisations, as well as in cases where documents with the same contents are requested from several applicants in ongoing marketing authorisation procedures.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0663">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0663"><!----></a>Section 24d<br />General right of use</p><p><a name="p0664"><!----></a>The competent higher federal authority is hereby empowered to utilise the documents submitted to it, with the exception of those referred to under section 22 (1) nos. 11, 14 and 15 as well as subsection (2) no. 1, and the expert report pursuant to section 24 (1) sentence 2 no. 1, in fulfilling its tasks under this Act, provided that at least eight years have elapsed since the medicinal product first received a marketing authorisation in one of the Member States of the European Union or a procedure pursuant to section 24c has not yet been terminated, or insofar as sections 24a and 24b do not contain more special provisions for referring to the documents of a previous applicant.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0665">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0665"><!----></a>Section 25<br />Decision on the marketing authorisation</p><p><a name="p0666"><!----></a>(1) The marketing authorisation, together with a marketing authorisation number, is issued in writing by the competent higher federal authority. The marketing authorisation is only applicable to the medicinal product specified in the marketing authorisation notice and, in the case of medicinal products manufactured according to homeopathic manufacturing procedures, it also applies to the degree of dilution specified in results published pursuant to section 25 (7) sentence 1 of the version in force prior to 17 August 1994 and specified in the marketing authorisation notice.</p><p><a name="p0667"><!----></a>(2) The competent higher federal authority may only refuse to grant the marketing authorisation if:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0668"><!----></a>1.  the documents submitted, including such documents as are to be submitted pursuant to a regulation of the European Community or the European Union, are incomplete,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0669"><!----></a>2.  the medicinal product has not been sufficiently tested in accordance with the confirmed state of scientific knowledge or the other scientific information material referred to in section 22 (3) does not correspond to the confirmed state of scientific knowledge,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0670"><!----></a>3.  the medicinal product is not manufactured in accordance with recognised pharmaceutical rules or does not meet appropriate quality standards,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0671"><!----></a>4.  the therapeutic efficacy attributed to the medicinal product by the applicant is lacking or is insufficiently substantiated by the applicant in accordance with the confirmed state of scientific knowledge,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0672"><!----></a>5.  the benefit/risk profile is unfavourable,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0673"><!----></a>5a.  in the case of a medicinal product containing more than one active substance, insufficient grounds are provided to demonstrate that each active substance contributes towards a positive assessment of the medicinal product, whereby the special features of the particular medicinal product should be considered in a risk evaluation,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0674"><!----></a>6.  the placing of the medicinal product on the market would violate legal regulations or a regulation, directive, decision or resolution by the European Community or the European Union.</p><p><a name="p0675"><!----></a>The marketing authorisation may not be refused pursuant to sentence 1 no. 4, because therapeutic results have been achieved in only a limited number of cases. Therapeutic efficacy is lacking if the applicant fails to prove, according to the confirmed state of scientific knowledge at the time, that a therapeutic effect can be produced with the medicinal product. Medical experience in the particular therapeutic field is to be considered.</p><p><a name="p0676"><!----></a>(3) The marketing authorisation is to be refused for a medicinal product which differs, in the type or the quantity of its active substances, from a medicinal product bearing the same name that has been authorised for marketing or is already on the market. Deviating from sentence 1, a difference in the quantity of active substances is harmless if the medicinal products differ in their pharmaceutical form.</p><p><a name="p0677"><!----></a>(4) If the competent higher federal authority is of the opinion that a marketing authorisation cannot be granted on the basis of the documents submitted, it notifies the applicant, stating reasons. The applicant is then to be given the opportunity to correct the flaw within an appropriate deadline, which may not exceed six months. In the event that the flaws are not corrected within this deadline, the marketing authorisation is to be refused. After the decision has been taken to refuse the marketing authorisation, the submission of documents in order to correct flaws is not allowed.</p><p><a name="p0678"><!----></a>(5) The marketing authorisation is to be granted based on the examination of the documents submitted and on the expert reports. In assessing the documents, the competent higher federal authority may utilise its own scientific results, call in experts or request expert reports. The competent higher federal authority may examine authorisation-related data and documents, also in connection with a marketing authorisation pursuant to Article 3 (1) or (2) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, in enterprises and facilities that develop, manufacture, test or clinically investigate medicinal products. For this purpose, persons commissioned by the competent higher federal authority, in consultation with the respective competent authorities, may enter the operating and business premises during usual business hours to inspect documents and request information. Moreover, in making a decision in respect of the marketing authorisation, the competent higher federal authority is also entitled to have the documents assessed by independent counter-experts and applies the results of their evaluation in deciding on the marketing authorisation and, insofar as medicinal products that are subject to mandatory prescription under section 48 (2) sentence 1 no. 1 are concerned, as a basis for the draft of the marketing authorisation decision that is to be submitted to the marketing authorisation commission pursuant to subsection (6) sentence 1. The competent higher federal authority may commission, as a counter-expert pursuant to sentence 5, any person who possesses the requisite expert knowledge and the reliability required to do the work of a counter-expert. Upon request, the applicant is to be permitted to peruse the expert reports. If the applicant requires that experts be called in whom he/she himself/herself selects, these persons are also to be heard. Subsection (6) sentences 5 and 6 apply accordingly for the appointment of experts and counter-experts.</p><p><a name="p0679"><!----></a>(5a) The competent higher federal authority also prepares an assessment report on the quality, safety and efficacy documents submitted and makes a statement on the findings of pharmaceutical and pre-clinical tests, clinical trials, as well as on the risk management and the pharmacovigilance system. The assessment report is to be updated if any new information becomes available.</p><p><a name="p0680"><!----></a>(5b) Subsection (5a) does not apply to medicinal products that have been manufactured according to homeopathic manufacturing procedures insofar as these medicinal products are subject to Article 16 (2) of Directive 2001/83/EC.</p><p><a name="p0681"><!----></a>(6) Prior to the decision on the marketing authorisation of a medicinal product that is attributed to the phytotherapy, homeopathy or anthroposophy schools of therapy and which is subject to prescription pursuant to section 48 (2) sentence 1 no. 1, a marketing authorisation commission is to be consulted. The hearing covers the contents of the documents presented, the expert reports, the reports requested, the comments of the experts summoned, the result of the tests and the reasons which played an essential role in the decision taken on the marketing authorisation or the assessment of the counter-experts. Should the higher federal authority diverge from the result of the hearing in deciding on the application, it must set forth its reasons for doing so. The Federal Ministry appoints the members of the marketing authorisation commission, taking into account the proposals of the chambers of the medical professions, the professional societies of medical practitioners, dentists, pharmacists, alternative practitioners, as well as the main central associations of the pharmaceutical entrepreneurs, patients and consumers responsible for representing their interests. In appointing the commission&#8217;s members, consideration is to be given to the individual peculiarities of the medicinal products. The experts to be appointed to the marketing authorisation commission are persons who possess scientific knowledge and have gained practical experience in the specific therapeutic indications as well as in the school of therapy in question (phytotherapy, homeopathy, anthroposophy).</p><p><a name="p0682"><!----></a>(7) For medicinal products not subject to prescription pursuant to section 48 (2) sentence 1 no. 1, commissions are set up for specific therapeutic indications or schools of therapy at the competent higher federal authority. Subsection (6) sentences 4 to 6 apply accordingly. In preparing the decision regarding the extension of marketing authorisations pursuant to section 105 (3) sentence 1, the competent higher federal authority may involve the competent commission. If the decision pursuant to sentence 3 affects medicinal products from a specific school of therapy (phytotherapy, homeopathy, anthroposophy), the competent commission is to be involved if the intention is to refuse the extension pursuant to section 105 (3) sentence 1 entirely, or if the decision is of fundamental importance; the competent commission must be afforded a period of two months within which to respond. In cases where the competent higher federal authority does not take the comments of the commission into account in making its decision under sentence 4, it sets forth its reasons for not doing so.</p><p><a name="p0683"><!----></a>(7a) In order to improve the safety of medicinal products for children and young people, a Commission on Medicinal Products intended for Children and Young People is to be set up at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices. Subsection (6) sentences 4 to 6 apply accordingly. In preparing the decision regarding an application for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product that is also intended for use in children and young people, the competent higher federal authority involves said commission. Furthermore, the competent higher federal authority is entitled to involve the commission when preparing a decision regarding an application for a marketing authorisation of a medicinal product, other than that specified in sentence 3, for which the administration to children or young people is envisaged. The commission has the opportunity to issue a report. In cases where the competent higher federal authority does not take the commission&#8217;s opinion into account in making its decision, it sets forth its reasons. Furthermore, in the case of medicinal products that have not been authorised for administration to children and young people, the commission may establish the prerequisites for their administration to children and young people in accordance with recognised scientific principles. In the case of medicinal products from the phytotherapeutic, homeopathic and anthroposophic schools of medicine, the tasks and authority conferred by sentences 3 to 7 are assumed by the commissions pursuant to subsection (7) sentence 4.</p><p><a name="p0684"><!----></a>(8) In the case of sera, vaccines, blood preparations, tissue preparations, allergens, xenogeneic medicinal products that are not medicinal products pursuant to section 4 (9), the competent higher federal authority grants the marketing authorisation either on the basis of an examination of the documents submitted, its own tests or based on observation of the tests carried out by the manufacturer. For this purpose, persons commissioned by the competent higher federal authority, in consultation with the respective competent authorities, may enter the operating and business premises during usual business hours and carry out inspections, both of said premises and of the company&#8217;s means of transport. At the request of the competent higher federal authority, the applicant must submit information on the manufacturing process.

Reports from patients and health care professionals can take any form, especially also electronic. Reports from marketing authorisation holders pursuant to section 63c are transmitted electronically. By collecting information and, when necessary, following up on reports of suspected adverse reactions, the competent higher federal authority ensures that all suitable measures are taken so as to clearly identify all biological medicinal products that are prescribed, dispensed or sold and pertaining to which reports of suspected adverse reactions have been made, whereby the name of the medicinal product and the number of the manufacturing batch are to be specified.</p><p><a name="p1304"><!----></a>(3) The competent higher federal authority must transmit every serious suspected adverse reaction reported that occurs on the territory governed by this Act within 15 days and on every reported non-serious suspected adverse reaction that occurs on the territory governed by this Act within 90 days, electronically, to the database referred to in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 (EudraVigilance database). The competent higher federal authority works together with the European Medicines Agency and the marketing authorisation holder to determine in particular whether there has been duplication in the recording of reported suspected adverse reactions. Where necessary, the competent higher federal authority also involves patients, health care professionals or the marketing authorisation holder in the follow-up of the reports received.</p><p><a name="p1305"><!----></a>(4) The competent higher federal authority controls the management of the funds intended for the performance of pharmacovigilance activities, the operation of the communication networks and market supervision in order to guarantee its independence in the performance of these pharmacovigilance activities.</p><p><a name="p1306"><!----></a>(5) The competent higher federal authority takes the following measures in cooperation with the European Medicines Agency:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1307"><!----></a>1.  monitoring the outcome of the risk minimisation measures contained in risk management plans as well as the conditions referred to in section 28 (3) and (3a) and (3b),</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1308"><!----></a>2.  assessing updates to the risk management system,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1309"><!----></a>3.  evaluating the data in the EudraVigilance database to determine whether there are new or changed risks, and whether this has an impact on the risk-benefit balance of medicinal products.</p><p><a name="p1310"><!----></a>(6) The competent higher federal authority can inspect the collection and evaluation of medicinal product risks and the co-ordination of necessary measures in enterprises and facilities that manufacture, place on the market or clinically test medicinal products. To this end, the representatives of the competent higher federal authority, in consultation with the competent authority, can enter the production areas and business premises during regular working hours, inspect documents including the pharmacovigilance master file and request information. Sentence 1 also applies to undertakings commissioned by enterprises and facilities pursuant to sentence 1. A report is to be drawn up on the inspection. The report is to be submitted to the enterprises and facilities pursuant to sentence 1 for comments. If an inspection results in the conclusion that the marketing authorisation holder fails to meet the requirements of the pharmacovigilance system as described in the pharmacovigilance master file, and above all the requirements of Division 10, the competent higher federal authority draws the attention of the marketing authorisation holder to the detected deficiencies and give the latter the opportunity to submit comments. In such cases, the competent higher federal authority informs the competent authorities of other Member States, the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1311">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1311"><!----></a>Section 63<br />Graduated plan</p><p><a name="p1312"><!----></a>By means of general administrative regulations subject to the approval of the Bundesrat, the Federal Government draws up a graduated plan detailing the execution of the tasks indicated in section 62.

In the case of section 14 (4) no. 4 and section 20b (2), the removal facilities and the laboratories are subject to supervision by the competent authority responsible for them locally; in the case of section 20c (2) sentence 2, the commissioned enterprises are subject to supervision by the competent authority responsible for them locally. Sentence 1 also applies to persons carrying out these activities professionally, to persons carrying with them medicinal products not exclusively intended for personal use, to the sponsor of a clinical trial or his/her representative, as well as to persons or associations collecting medicinal products for others. Sentence 1 does not apply to reconstitution insofar as medicinal products that are intended for use in clinical trials are not concerned.</p><p><a name="p1421"><!----></a>(2) Persons in charge of supervision must carry out this activity as their main profession. The competent authority may call in experts. Insofar as blood preparations, tissues and tissue preparations, radiopharmaceuticals, medicinal products produced using genetic engineering, sera, vaccines, allergens, advanced therapy medicinal products, xenogeneic medicinal products or active substances or other substances of human, animal or microbial origin or which have been manufactured using genetic engineering are concerned, the competent authority is to summon staff of the competent higher federal authority to participate as experts. With regard to pharmacies that are not hospital pharmacies or that do not require an authorisation in compliance with section 13, the competent authority may commission experts to carry out the supervision.</p><p><a name="p1422"><!----></a>(3) The competent authority is to satisfy itself that the provisions on medicinal products, on active substances and other substances intended for use in the manufacture of medicinal products, as well as on tissues, on advertising in the field of medicine, of Division 2 of the Transfusion Act, of Divisions 2, 3 and 3a of the Transplantation Act, and those on pharmacies, are observed. To this end, the competent authority is to, based on a supervision system, paying special attention to possible risks, with appropriate frequency and to an appropriate extent, also conduct unannounced inspections where necessary and stipulate effective follow-up measures. It is to also commission the official testing of medicinal product samples.</p><p><a name="p1423"><!----></a>Unannounced inspections are necessary particularly:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1424"><!----></a>1.  in cases of suspected counterfeiting of medicinal products or active substances,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1425"><!----></a>2.  where there is indication of a serious defects in medicinal products or active substances, as well as</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1426"><!----></a>3.  at appropriate intervals, within the framework of supervising the manufacture of medicinal products pursuant to section 35 of the Ordinance on the Operation of Pharmacies (<i>Apothekenbetriebsordnung</i>) and the manufacture of medicinal products for parenteral use for pharmacies.</p><p><a name="p1427"><!----></a>(3a) Enterprises and establishments requiring an authorisation pursuant to sections 13, 20c, 72, 72b (1) or section 72c, as well as pharmacies that manufacture medicinal products pursuant to section 35 of the Ordinance on the Operation of Pharmacies are to be inspected every two years, as a rule, pursuant to subsection (3). The competent authority grants an authorisation pursuant to sections 13, 20c, 52a, 72, 72b (1) or section 72c only after having satisfied itself, by means of an inspection, that the requirements for granting an authorisation are fulfilled.</p><p><a name="p1428"><!----></a>(3b) The competent authority conducts the inspections to monitor compliance with the provisions governing the trade in medicinal products in accordance with the guidelines of the European Commission pursuant to Article 111a of Directive 2001/83/EC, insofar as the supervision of the conduct of clinical trials is not concerned. It co-operates with the European Medicines Agency by exchanging information on planned and conducted inspections as well as in the co-ordination of inspections of enterprises and facilities in countries that are not Member States of the European Union or other States Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p><p><a name="p1429"><!----></a>(3c) The inspections can also be carried out at the request of another Member State, the European Commission or the European Medicines Agency. Without prejudice to any other agreements between the European Union and countries that are not members of the European Union or other States Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, the competent authority can require a manufacturer in the country that is not a member of the Union or a State Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area to submit him/herself to an inspection in accordance with the requirements of the European Union.</p><p><a name="p1430"><!----></a>(3d) A report is to be drawn up on the inspection.

The certificate of compliance with the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice are to be valid for not more than three years, the certificate on compliance with the principles and guidelines of good distribution practice no more than five years. The certificate is to be withdrawn if it subsequently becomes known that the conditions were not fulfilled; it is to be revoked if the conditions no longer apply.</p><p><a name="p1433"><!----></a>(3g) The information regarding the issue, refusal, withdrawal or revocation of a certificate on compliance with the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice is to be entered into a database pursuant to section 67a. This also applies to the issuing, withdrawal, revocation or suspension of an authorisation pursuant to section 13, or section 72 (1) and (2), as well as to the registration and deletion of medicinal product brokers or of enterprises and facilities that manufacture, import or otherwise trade in active substances without requiring an authorisation. The information regarding the issue, refusal, withdrawal or revocation of an authorisation pursuant to section 52a, as well as a certificate of compliance with the principles and guidelines of good distribution practice, is to be entered into a database of the European Medicines Agency pursuant to Article 111 (6) of Directive 2001/83/EC.</p><p><a name="p1434"><!----></a>(3h) Subsections (3b), (3c) and (3e) to (3g) do not apply to enterprises and establishments that set up or manage a repository that is part of the repositories system referred to in Article 31 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/161.</p><p><a name="p1435"><!----></a>(3i) By way of derogation from subsection (3c), the competent authority must decide, on a duly justified request by another Member State of the European Union into which tissues or tissue preparations that were previously imported into the territory governed by this Act are to be imported, to inspect an importing tissue establishment that is subject to the obligation to obtain an authorisation pursuant to section 72b (1) or section 72c (1), or take other supervisory measures. The other Member State is first given an opportunity to comment. Sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly to a duly justified request by another Member State of the European Union, into which haematopoietic stem cells and stem cell preparations derived from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood that were previously imported into the territory governed by this Act are to be imported, to inspect an importing establishment that is subject to the obligation to obtain an authorisation pursuant to section 72b (4) or section 72c (4) sentence one in conjunction with subsection (1), or take other supervisory measures.</p><p><a name="p1436"><!----></a>(3j) In the event of an inspection pursuant to subsection (3i), the competent authority can, based on the request by the competent authority of the other Member State, permit persons designated by said Member State to attend the inspection. The competent authority must justify its rejection of the request to the competent authority of the other Member State. The accompanying persons are authorised, together with the persons in charge of supervision, to enter and inspect properties, office premises and means of transport during normal business hours.</p><p><a name="p1437"><!----></a>(3k) The competent authority informs the competent higher federal authority of planned inspections of manufacturers of medicinal products or active substances in third countries. Officials of the competent higher federal authority may participate in such inspections as experts, in consultation with the competent authority. This is without prejudice to subsection (2) sentence 3.</p><p><a name="p1438"><!----></a>(4) The persons charged with monitoring are authorised</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1439"><!----></a>1.  to enter and inspect during normal business hours properties, office premises, operating rooms, transport facilities and also, for the prevention of imminent danger to public order and security, residential housing and to take pictures for documentation purposes in office premises, operating rooms and means of transport in which the activities referred to in subsection (1) are carried out; the fundamental right to the inviolability of the home (Article 13 of the Basic Law) is limited in this regard,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1440"><!----></a>2.  to review documentation on the development, manufacture, testing, clinical trial, acquisition, import, storing, packaging, billing, placing on the market and other whereabouts of the medicinal products, active substances and other substances intended for the manufacture of medicinal products, as well as on the advertising material currently in circulation and on the liability coverage required pursuant to section 94,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1441"><!----></a>2a.  to prepare or request transcripts or photocopies of documents pursuant to no. 2 or printouts or copies of data storage media on which documents pursuant to no. 2 are stored insofar as personal data from patients are not concerned,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1442"><!----></a>3.  to demand from natural and legal persons and associations without legal capacity all the necessary information, in particular on the company operations specified in no. 2,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p1443"><!----></a>4.  to issue provisional orders also on the closing of the company or facility, insofar as this is deemed necessary for the prevention of imminent danger to public order and safety.</p><p><a name="p1444"><!----></a>(4a) If it is required for the implementation of this Act or of ordinances issued on the basis of this Act or Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, experts from the Member States of the European Union may exercise the powers contained in subsection (4) no. 1, if they are in the company of the persons responsible for the supervision.</p><p><a name="p1445"><!----></a>(5) The person under obligation to give information may refuse to answer certain questions if he/she has reason to fear that answering them could expose him/her or one of the relatives specified in section 383 (1) nos. 1 to 3 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (<i>Zivilprozeßordnung</i>) to the danger of prosecution under criminal law or to a lawsuit under the Act on Administrative Offences (<i>Gesetz über Ordnungswidrigkeiten</i>).</p><p><a name="p1446"><!----></a>(6) The Federal Ministry is hereby empowered, to issue, by ordinance subject to the approval of the Bundesrat, regulations governing the fulfilment of supervisory tasks in cases where medicinal products are imported into the territory governed by this Act, by a pharmaceutical entrepreneur who has no registered place of business in the territory governed by this Act, insofar as necessary for the implementation of the provisions governing the trade in medicinal products as well as advertising in the field of medicine. In the process, the main responsibility for supervisory tasks, which arise out of the import of a medicinal product from a specific Member State of the European Union, can be assigned in each case to a specific Land or to a facility supported by one of the <i>Länder</i>.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p1447">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1447"><!----></a>Section 65<br />Sampling</p><p><a name="p1448"><!----></a>(1) To the extent necessary for the implementation of the provisions on the trade in medicinal products, on advertising in the field of medicine of Division 2 of the Transfusion Act, of Divisions 2, 3 and 3a of the Transplantation Act and on pharmacies, those persons in charge of supervision are authorised to demand or to take samples of their own selection, against receipt, for the purposes of testing them. Insofar as the pharmaceutical entrepreneur does not explicitly waive his/her right thereto, a part of the sample or, if the sample is not divisible in parts of equal quality without endangering the purpose of the test, a second sample of the same type as the sample taken, is to be left behind.</p><p><a name="p1449"><!----></a>(2) The samples left behind are to be officially closed or sealed.
