If repair or replacement is not carried out without delay, revenue authorities shall have the right to ban the manufacturer&#8217;s programmes from being used for the electronic transmission of data to revenue authorities.

Decisions on the type and scope of investigations may take the general experience of revenue authorities, as well as cost-effectiveness and expedience, into account.</p><p><a name="p0747"><!----></a>(3) To ensure the timely and consistent execution of tax laws, the highest revenue authorities may, for identified or identifiable categories of cases, issue instructions on the type and scope of investigations and the processing of data collected or recorded, unless otherwise required by law. Such instructions may take the general experience of revenue authorities, as well as cost-effectiveness and expedience, into account. Such instructions may not be made public if doing so could jeopardise the consistency and lawfulness of taxation.

Data attributed or assigned to a specific taxpayer or tax office in accordance with the first sentence above shall be forwarded to the <i>Länder</i>, taking into account any instructions issued by the Federal Ministry of Finance in accordance with subsection (3) above. Data not forwarded to <i>Land</i> revenue authorities shall be stored by the Federal Central Tax Office for the purpose of proceedings described in section 30(2) numbers 1a) and 1b), until the expiration of the 15th year following the year when the data were received.

The principle of cost-effective administration should be taken into account here. At a minimum, risk management systems must ensure that:</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0750"><!----></a>1.   a sufficient number of cases are selected, on the basis of random selection, for comprehensive review by officials,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0751"><!----></a>2.   officials review those cases sorted out as requiring review,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0752"><!----></a>3.   officials are able to select cases for comprehensive review,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0753"><!----></a>4.   regular reviews are conducted to determine whether risk management systems are fulfilling their objectives.</p><p><a name="p0754"><!----></a>The details of risk management systems must not be made public if doing so could jeopardise the consistency and lawfulness of taxation.

The revenue authority that would have local jurisdiction if the underlying circumstances specified in the request were to be realised shall be responsible for issuing an advance ruling. Where no revenue authority has jurisdiction under sections 18 to 21 for the applicant at the time the request is filed, jurisdiction shall lie with the Federal Central Tax Office for taxes administered by <i>Land</i> revenue authorities on behalf of the Federation, notwithstanding the second sentence above; in such cases, an advance ruling shall also bind the revenue authority that has jurisdiction upon realisation of the underlying circumstances specified in the ruling. The competent revenue authority should make a decision on a request for an advance ruling within six months after the request is received; if the revenue authority cannot make a decision on a request by this deadline, it shall notify the applicant accordingly, stating its reasons. The Federal Ministry of Finance shall be authorised to stipulate, by way of ordinances issued with the consent of the Bundesrat, more detailed provisions on the form, content and conditions of requests for advance rulings, and on the scope of the binding effect of such rulings. Ordinances may also specify the conditions under which single advance rulings are to be issued that apply to multiple participants and which revenue authority is responsible for issuing advance rulings in such cases. Such ordinances above shall not require the consent of the Bundesrat where they concern insurance tax.</p><p><a name="p0768"><!----></a>(3) A fee shall be charged for processing requests for advance rulings in accordance with subsection (2) above. In cases where a single advance ruling is issued that applies to multiple applicants, only one fee shall be charged; in such cases, all applicants are jointly liable for the fee. The fee shall be payable by the applicant within one month following notification that the fee has been set. The revenue authority may delay its decision on an application until the fee has been paid.</p><p><a name="p0769"><!----></a>(4) Fees shall be calculated on the basis of the value the advance ruling represents for the applicant (object value). The applicant should state the object value and the circumstances relevant to its determination in his application for advance ruling. Fees are to be calculated by the revenue authority on the basis of the object value as declared by the applicant insofar as this does not lead to an obviously incorrect resultant amount. Where the value of the object cannot be determined even by way of estimate, a time related fee shall be charged; this shall be 50 euros per half hour or portion thereof, the minimum charge being 100 euros.</p><p><a name="p0770"><!----></a>(5) In corresponding application of section 34 of the Court Fees Act, the fee shall be levied at a rate of 1.0 percent. Section 39(2) of the Court Fees Act shall apply accordingly. If the object value is less than 10,000 euros, no fee shall be levied.</p><p><a name="p0771"><!----></a>(6) If the object value is not determinable and cannot be determined by way of estimate, a time-related fee shall be charged; this shall be 50 euros for each half hour of processing time or portion thereof. If the processing time is less than two hours, no fee shall be levied.</p><p><a name="p0772"><!----></a>(7) The fee may be waived in full or in part where its collection would be unreasonable in individual cases. In particular, the fee may be reduced where an application for advance ruling is withdrawn before the revenue authority&#8217;s decision is issued.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0773">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0773"><!----></a>Section 90<br />Obligation of participants to cooperate</p><p><a name="p0774"><!----></a>(1) Participants shall be obliged to cooperate with the authorities in establishing the facts of the case.

The extent of this obligation shall be determined by the circumstances of the individual case.</p><p><a name="p0775"><!----></a>(2) Where circumstances relating to transactions effected outside the territory of application of this Code are to be established and subjected to the provisions of tax law, the participants shall clarify these circumstances and procure the necessary evidence. In doing so, they shall exhaust all legal and practical means available to them. Where there are objectively recognisable indications to assume that the taxpayer has business relations with financial institutions in a state or territory with which there is no agreement to provide information in accordance with Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital in the version of 2005, or the state or the territory does not provide information to a comparable extent or is not willing to engage in a corresponding provision of information, the taxpayer shall at the revenue authority&#8217;s request make a sworn statement affirming the correctness and completeness of the details provided by him and authorise the revenue authority to assert on his behalf, both in and out of court, the possible entitlement to information against the credit institutions named by the revenue authority; the sworn statement may not be compelled pursuant to section 328. A participant may not plead inability to clarify circumstances or to submit evidence when he, depending on the case, could, in structuring his circumstances, have afforded himself or have himself given the opportunity to do so.</p><p><a name="p0776"><!----></a>(3) Taxpayers shall keep records on the nature and content of their business relations that fall under the definition provided under section 1 subsection (4) of the External Tax Relations Act. The obligation to keep records shall encompass business transactions (documentation of facts); the economic and legal aspects of any arm&#8217;s length agreement on terms of business, especially prices (transfer prices); and information on when the transfer prices were set, which transfer pricing method was used, and which comparability data were used (documentation of commensurateness). If a taxpayer is required to keep records as described in the first sentence above for an enterprise that forms part of a multinational enterprise group, such records shall include an overview of the type of business activities conducted by the enterprise group and of the transfer pricing method used by the group, unless the enterprise&#8217;s revenue in the previous financial year totalled less than 100 million euros. A multinational enterprise group is any group comprised of at least two enterprises that are related within the meaning of section 1 subsection (2) of the External Tax Relations Act and that are resident in different countries, or any group comprised of at least one enterprise with at least one permanent establishment in another country. Revenue authorities should require the submission of records only for the purpose of conducting an external audit. Such submissions shall be governed by section 97. Submissions shall be made on request within a period of 60 days. Records of exceptional business transactions shall be compiled as soon as possible and submitted within a period of 30 days upon request by the revenue authorities. The period for submission stipulated in the seventh and eighth sentences above may be extended in duly justified individual cases. Additional records shall be submitted upon request by the revenue authorities. In order to ensure the uniform application of the law, the Federal Ministry of Finance shall be authorised to stipulate, by way of ordinances issued with the consent of the Bundesrat, the type, content and extent of the records to be kept.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="index-2.html#gl_p0777">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0777"><!----></a>Section 91<br />Participant consultation</p><p><a name="p0778"><!----></a>(1) Before an administrative act affecting the rights of a participant may be issued, he should be given the opportunity to comment on the facts relevant to the decision.
