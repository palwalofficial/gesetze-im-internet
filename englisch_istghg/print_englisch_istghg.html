The judge draws persons pursued&#8217;s attention to their right to avail themselves of the services of legal counsel (section 31) at any stage of the proceedings and to the fact that they are free to either make a statement or not make a statement regarding the offence of which they are accused. The judge then instructs persons pursued that they may apply for enforcement of the warrant of arrest pending surrender to be suspended and may apply to the Court at any time in connection with the warrant of arrest, and the judge then asks whether and, possibly, for what reasons they wish to raise objections to the surrender; section 41 (5) sentence 1 applies accordingly. In the case under section 11 (2), the hearing also encompasses the subject matter of the accusation; in all other cases, any information which persons pursued volunteer is to be placed on record.

The public prosecution office at the higher regional court is responsible for ensuring that the higher regional court gives such a decision without delay; the Court&#8217;s involvement is governed by Article 59 (4) to (6) of the Rome Statute.

The judge must draw their attention to the right to avail themselves of the services of legal counsel at any stage of the proceedings and to the fact that they are free to either make a statement or not make a statement regarding the offence of which they are accused. The judge then asks whether and, if so, for what reasons they wish to object to the warrant of arrest pending transit or to the permissibility of the transit.

The provisions of the Criminal Code (<i>Strafgesetzbuch</i>) on the suspension of enforcement of the remainder of a determinate sentence of imprisonment or of imprisonment for life (sections 57 to 57b of the Criminal Code) and of the Code of Criminal Procedure on enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment do not apply. Enforcement is to end upon notification by the Court.</p><p><a name="p0210"><!----></a>(3) Upon transmission of a request by the Court, the sentenced person is to be surrendered back to the Court or to a state designated by it. If the Court does not give explicit notification that the sentenced person is to be released, said person is to be kept in detention until their surrender to the Court or to the authorities of the state designated by the Court. If, at a later date, the Court transmits a request for the continuation of enforcement of a penalty which has been partially enforced in Germany, the documents referred to in subsection (1) no. 1 need not be transmitted a second time. Subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 2 and sentence 2 applies accordingly.</p><p><a name="p0211"><!----></a>(4) The Court is responsible for giving those decisions relating to enforcement of a penalty, including in respect of a pardon, resumption of proceedings and reduction of the sentence imposed by the Court, and other decisions which may involve the sentenced person staying outside of the facility in which they are being detained without being under guard. If circumstances arise which, under German law, would enable postponement, temporary postponement, interruption of enforcement, dispensing with enforcement, crediting against the term of imprisonment or prison orders outside a detention facility without being under guard, then the Court is to be requested to give a decision. In all other cases, enforcement of a penalty is governed by the provisions of German law and corresponds to the enforcement of penalties imposed by German courts for comparable offences. The provisions of the Prison Act on complaint proceedings and court proceedings do not apply if the Court is responsible for giving a decision on enforcement measures.</p><p><a name="p0212"><!----></a>(5) Communication between the sentenced person and the Court is free and confidential.

No further request from the Court is needed for individual search measures to be taken. Section 31 (2) sentence 1 of the Act on Senior Judicial Officials (<i>Rechtspflegergesetz</i>) applies accordingly.

A decision is sought from the Court in respect of interpreting the verdict of guilty or the sentence, calculating the penalty imposed, objections to the permissibility of enforcement of a penalty or if, under German law, the conditions of section 459a of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be met. Enforcement is not stayed as a result; the agency competent under section 46 (2) may, however, postpone or suspend enforcement.

Before authorisation is given, the order has the effect of a prohibition of disposal within the meaning of section 136 of the Civil Code (<i>Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch</i>); the prohibition also covers disposals other than sale. Property in respect of which an order for confiscation of the proceeds of crime has been made is surrendered to the Court upon mutual assistance being authorised.</p><p><a name="p0233"><!----></a>(4) If the Court&#8217;s order for confiscation of the proceeds of crime includes a decision in respect of the rights of third parties, that decision is binding, unless </p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0234"><!----></a>1.  the third party manifestly was not afforded sufficient opportunity to assert their rights,</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0235"><!----></a>2.  the decision is incompatible with a decision under civil law given in Germany in the same matter or</p><p class="Liste1"><a name="p0236"><!----></a>3.  the decision refers to the rights of third parties in a plot of real land or a right in a plot of real land situated in Germany; the rights of third parties include priority notices.</p><p><a name="p0237"><!----></a>In the cases under sentence 1, the Court is to be afforded the opportunity to make a statement in proceedings under section 68 (1). The rights of third parties in the property remain to the extent provided for under the Rome Statute. Third parties who, given the circumstances of the individual case, could assert rights in the property are afforded the opportunity to make a statement before the decision is given, unless they have already been afforded the opportunity to make a statement before the Court.

Where property is located in the districts of various higher regional courts, jurisdiction lies with that higher regional court or, if no higher regional court is yet seised of the case, with that public prosecution office which was first seised of the case.

Further, the higher regional court gives decisions on the permissibility of the surrender of objects upon the application of the public prosecution office at the higher regional court or upon the application of any person who asserts that their rights would be infringed if the property were to be surrendered.
